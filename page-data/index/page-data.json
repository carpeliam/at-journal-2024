Day #1 on the AT! It was enough just getting here ‚Äî I took the train down the previous night (yes, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A0F9lh8TiSM?si=WNNgeRtjFpZy0PGU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Midnight Train to Georgia</a>), paying a bit more for a fold-out bed but not like it was easy to fall asleep anyway. On the ride down, I was massaging my foot, dealing with some muscle tightness from an impromptu run the day before. Well, however ready my body is or isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm here.</p>\n<p>The train pulled in about 30 minutes late into Gainesville GA but <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063487306565\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ron</a> my shuttle driver made it work. On the ride there, Ron quizzed his three passengers on preparedness: did we know about the norovirus outbreak? did we know about long water carries? how much water were we carrying? In almost every fact that Ron talked about, there was at least one kernel I wasn‚Äôt already aware of. One of the other passengers had attempted the AT last year, and made it nearly a week before stopping; she knew her knees wouldn‚Äôt see her to Katahdin, but she just wanted to get farther this year than she did last year. The other passenger was carrying a portable CPAP machine to manage his sleep apnea. And here I was with a 40L pack, thankful that the electronics portion of my base weight was so much more manageable.</p>\n<p>Ron dropped us off at the Amicalola Falls Visitor Center, where I was just in time to sign in, get my hang tag, weigh my pack, and attend a short slideshow lecture on the Georgia part of the trail. One thing that stuck with me was the advice to only hike around 8 miles each day in the first few days, even if my lungs and muscles were fine with more, due to the time it takes for ligaments/tendons to warm up. It sounded like good advice, and I plan at least to not totally ignore it. I took one last photo of a sheet marked ‚ÄúGEORGIA SHUTTLE DRIVERS‚Äù, made sure I had everything, and walked on out, as the next wave of arrivers was getting started with the same slideshow lecture. It was 10am by this time, and I needed to get this party started if I wanted to make some miles and get to camp at a decent hour.</p>\n<p>Just as I was walking out, I saw Haroula, a fellow Bostonian whose sister was apparently starting the trail on the same day as me. Haroula‚Äôs whole family had come down to see her sister off. Haroula called out to me as I left the visitor center, and I told her about my eventful train ride down. She told me her sister had started an hour ago, but was planning to camp at the same shelter I was. I was excited to come into the trail already ‚Äúknowing‚Äù someone, even if I only actually knew her sister, and not even that well.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the approach trail was a bunch of stairs. There was some renovation going on, so the normal path up the ‚ÄúStairs of Death‚Äù (a respected rite of passage) was inaccessible; in their stead were an equally grueling set of stairs. But once I got up, there was still a beautiful sight to take in: the tallest waterfall in the state of Georgia.</p>\n<p>The top of Amicalola Falls was approximately 1 mile into my day, but I still had another 7 miles to get to the top of Springer Mountain where the trail actually began, and then another 3 miles to get to my shelter destination of Stover Creek. The hike up was pretty manageable, and the wooded summit still gave a good view on the mountains Somewhere Out There. But now I‚Äôm actually on the trail. The one with the white blazes. While chilling out at the summit, I met Brad, from Florida. Brad was also thru hiking, but his parents had come up to Springer to hike with him on his first day. I chatted with them a bit about the excitement, nerves, and expectations, but soon I said goodbye and gave them the mountain to themselves.</p>\n<p>I finished up at Stover Creek Shelter around 3:30pm, leaving me a few hours before sunset to set up my tent and get dinner. I found a cozy piece of ground outside the shelter to make food; norovirus stuck around on surfaces for periods of up to 2 weeks or so, which made the shelters themselves somewhat off limits. While I ate, I chatted with someone who turned out to be Dema, Haroula‚Äôs sister. A little while later, Thomas and Kyler came over and hung out, and we all chatted about expectations. Thomas had hiked as far as Virginia a few years back, and that opened up more questions. What were the Smokies like? How were resupplies? But we also all wondered, how big was the thru-hiker turnout this year? How big would the bubble be? As much as I want to let the trail wash over me, I also want to get past the bubble. It seems like a lot of hikers signed up to start in March, and given that no one is staying in the shelters, the tent sites will likely be packed.</p>\n<p>It was pretty cold and windy by the end of the night, down to around 38¬∫, and the next few nights are supposed to be colder. I guess I‚Äôll learn all about what Georgia mountains are like in Spring.</p>"},"previous":null},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":2,"date":"2024-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Gooch Mountain Shelter","end":15.7,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"üôÇ","sleepScore":58,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":2},"html":"<p>It was cold, waking up. As I lay under my quilt, I could already hear the other tents around me, packing up and chatting to each other quietly. Two people accidentally kicked one of my tent stakes ‚Äî either camp is crowded, or I need to do a better job pounding stakes into the ground, or both.</p>\n<p>I got out of camp kind of late (after 9am?). After about 2.5 miles in, I saw Forklift (who I met in passing yesterday) and her friend Mosey, stopped at a waterfall. I wasn‚Äôt going to say no to new opportunities, and I walked the 0.2 miles down a side trail to get a view of the falls. I was impressed that Forklift and Mosey already had trail names on just Day 2 ‚Äî apparently they had met while hiking the PCT. The falls was nice ‚Äî two waterfalls in two days! ‚Äî and I wonder a bit if every day will have a little side quest just like this. Mosey offered to take a picture of me with the falls, but I declined; I didn‚Äôt want to make my journey about me, and I didn‚Äôt want to stop observing. But Mosey said from experience that one of the biggest mistakes one could make was to not get pictures of themselves along the way, to see how they changed from start to finish. I‚Äôll have to keep that in mind, how I can capture my own change without being a tourist of the trail.</p>\n<p>Damn, does Sassafras Mountain have steep grade. ü•µ</p>\n<p>Before I started the trail, I planned to use the AT Guide <a href=\"https://www.theatguide.com/12-milesday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12 mile</a>/<a href=\"https://www.theatguide.com/15-milesday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15 mile</a> plans as a baseline for where I might want to stop for the night, given no other factors. But those plans assume you‚Äôre starting from mile 0 at the summit of Springer Mountain, whereas I started some 8 miles before then, so I subtracted a little from the plan in order to make similar miles. About 11 miles from Stover Creek is Devil‚Äôs Kitchen, which has spots for 8 tents. But when I got there, it ‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt look appetizing. It just didn‚Äôt feel right. And there were some guys taking a water break at the creek right before it, and they were planning on moving on. So I decided to let momentum take me another mile and a half to Gooch Mountain Shelter.</p>\n<p>Gooch Mountain Shelter seems like it‚Äôs well organized out of necessity. As you enter the grounds, there‚Äôs a map of where all the campsites are, and signs saying that each dirt tent pad should have two tents. I went off to start setting up on an empty dirt pad, wondering who my neighbor for the night might be, as the campground would certainly fill up. Shortly after I finished setting up, Clark and his daughter Olivia rolled in. Olivia was planning to do a large section of the AT (maybe the whole thing), while her dad was planning on hiking with her for just the first week before returning home. When I told Olivia that I was from Boston, she said that she was planning to move to the area after college, but she wasn‚Äôt sure yet exactly what she hoped to find there ‚Äî with a background in music and english, I told her I‚Äôd connect her with my friend who teaches in Mass. There was just enough signal to send a text out. Clark offered me the use of his sit pad when he noticed I didn‚Äôt have my own, and I was just about to graciously accept when I took my hand away at the last moment. He must have been confused until I explained to him about the norovirus outbreak, and we weren‚Äôt supposed to touch other people‚Äôs stuff. I think he was grateful that I told him, as he said he didn‚Äôt know ‚Äî they both seem nice. I really like how the trail kind of comes with its own in-built community, and Clark and Olivia and I can all kind of interact as friends, making connections and offering sit pads and sleeping within 5 feet of each other, without ever seeing each other before today.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":"Amicalola Falls","destination":"Stover Creek Shelter","end":2.8}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":3,"date":"2024-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Bull Gap","end":32.4,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"üôÇ","sleepScore":50,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":1},"html":"<p>I woke up to the sound of Clark and Olivia chatting and making plans. It turns out, Olivia came down with norovirus and started presenting symptoms this morning. I guess symptoms show up around 12 hours after contracting the virus, so I‚Äôm really glad now that I didn‚Äôt borrow that sit pad from Clark. Their plan of hiking for a week through Georgia has been cut short, and now their new plan is to get off trail as soon as possible. I gave them the photo of all the Georgia shuttle drivers, and told them that my shuttle driver Ron was great, but I guess Ron has a full plate and won‚Äôt be able to get them out until this afternoon. I made oatmeal and coffee, partly as a means to boil the water I had in yet another attempt to keep norovirus at bay, and chatted with them while they planned. This morning was an even later start to my hike than yesterday, not leaving camp until around 9:45. More or less everybody had cleared out before me.</p>\n<p>Today‚Äôs hike included Blood Mountain, the high point of the Georgia section. Ron had made it sound like a challenge, but it didn‚Äôt seem very strenuous. All around the mountain are these little clusters of short trees, I don‚Äôt know what they are ‚Äî I want to call them olive gardens, because that‚Äôd be hilarious, even though they‚Äôre definitely not olive trees. At the base of the mountain is Neels Gap (or Neel Gap, depending on who you talk to or which sign you read); after the arches and steps and waterfall of Amicalola and the summit of Springer Mountain on Day 1, this was my first AT landmark, home of the iconic <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-appalachian-trail-shoe-tree\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shoe tree</a>. It‚Äôs also the first spot along the trail that sells pizza. They sell frozen pizza, but they‚Äôll microwave it <em>for free</em>. What a country. I bought a ton of other snacks including a tuna packet, chocolate milk, some iced tea, a lighter and some hand sanitizer, and I think they conned me into buying an extra fuel canister unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>While I ate my pizza, I chatted with Dema and Forklift. Looking at FarOut, the ubiquitous trail smartphone app, the next shelter was Vogel State Park, though they charged $25 for tent sites, which didn‚Äôt sound great. But Dema and Forklift said that just a mile up the trail was Bull Gap, a tent-only campsite that had room for plenty of tents. This sounded great, as I hadn‚Äôt even considered staying outside of the grounds of a shelter.</p>\n<p>I got to Bull Gap and set up my tent, but I don‚Äôt think I did a great job. This is my first trekking pole tent, and while it looks easy on YouTube, it‚Äôs definitely not easy for me. Even when I feel like I‚Äôm doing it somewhat efficiently, it still takes probably twice as long as those practiced YouTubers. And the tent I have (a Durston XMid Pro) is a pretty popular tent ‚Äî I wonder if I‚Äôll see anyone else with it and be able to grab some pointers. After setting up for the night, I had my first opportunity to cross another milestone off my list: I dug my first cat hole.

Technically, I was offered trail magic on my first day, but it felt weird being offered a candy bar on my first day out, so I declined.

I heard conflicting reports from Bullfrog about when the shuttle from Dick‚Äôs Creek leaves for Hiawassee, so I aimed for the most aggressive time frame (1pm) and beat it slightly only to wait an hour for the shuttle. A little while after I arrived, a white minivan pulled in, and a woman reported quietly that she was offering trail magic. In her trunk, she had just about everything you could ask for. I scored a banana, an orange, and some gatorade, though I could have gone back for more. A little while later, the shuttle pulled up. The shuttle had a hiker box in the back, and the driver (who had retired a few years back and was now driving this shuttle a few days a week just to be a good guy) offered up anything and everything inside of it. I scored a zip-lock baggie of freeze-dried strawberries, partly because I think I can use the baggie.</p>\n<p>He dropped us off at Ingles, a grocery chain, in Hiawassee. I quietly discovered that Ingles is pronounced like Shingles, not like In-Glace as if it were Spanish.

The potato salad was delicious.</p>\n<p>Ingles had everything I needed, and while I sat at the in-store Starbucks repacking my bear canister, another hiker stopped and chatted with me a bit. She asked me if I had seen the eclipse today, but I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be an attraction this far away from its path. Apparently, she said, it was still somewhat visible, and she gave me her pair of eclipse sunglasses, my best trail magic yet.

Another few milestones. As I was figuring out the best way to pack up my wet tent (solution: the same as normal, except wetter), I found a tent stake in the mud left over at the tent closest to mine. Some guys waiting out the rain by the shelter said she left just a little bit before me, so I did the best I could to catch up ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt get a tenth of the mile up the trail before realizing I had left my inReach satellite device back at the tent site. I definitely can‚Äôt be losing things like that, not this early! I ended up catching up to the tent stake‚Äôs proper owner about 4 miles in, just before we got to the Georgia/North Carolina state border. We both spent a few minutes desperately trying to unlock our phones to in order to take a photo, but it was so wet that the touch screen wasn‚Äôt registering my finger very well. Finally, I got mine open, and we both took a photo with the sign. I‚Äôll have to send her photo when I get into town. Right after the border was this really cool tree that I‚Äôve seen pictures of in other peoples‚Äô journals, but I didn‚Äôt realize that it was in this part of the trail! Even though it was wet, it was exciting to cross into North Carolina, and none of the mud here is anything like what I saw in Vermont last year.</p>\n<p>I met Austin, and we were both thinking of heading to Standing Indian Shelter tonight. I got there a little bit before him, and started chatting to the two guys in the shelter, telling them that I was planning to tent (my tent was already wet), but Austin was planning to stay in the shelter with them. One of the guys started saying that Austin better not keep his food in the shelter, because he‚Äôs not going to be a party to some bear coming in and ruining the place. He went on for a little while about other people not appreciating bear safety, without any prompt from me. The guy just seemed irritated about just about everything. Somehow he found his way to complaining about how the White Mountains were not nearly as grandiose as everyone made them out to be. His friend, on the other hand, was a gentle soul, but also in rough shape ‚Äî he was upset with his pants, but felt compelled to wear them because his wife had gifted them to him and he didn‚Äôt want to let her down. When Austin arrived a little while later, the first guy was still getting upset about everything, and Austin looked at me so as to say, ‚Äúare you getting a weird vibe from him too?‚Äù And I gave him back a look that said, yep, I‚Äôm getting the same vibe. I‚Äôm definitely tenting tonight, there‚Äôs too much weird energy going on with these two.</p>\n<p>All of the shelters I stayed at in Georgia had bear boxes.

Franklin has a shuttle system just like Hiawassee, and picks up at both Rock Gap and Winding Stair Gap, which is 3 or 4 miles further down the trail. Winding Stair would be the ideal spot given that it would put us back on trail with fewer miles to walk, but we weren‚Äôt sure if we could make it there before the 9:30am shuttle, so sure enough I found some of my shelter mates huddled under a tree at Rock Gap. I came up singing ‚ÄúSinging in the Rain‚Äù, just enjoying the weather. As the shuttle pulled up, we waited for people to get off first before we got on; I guess the stairs were super slippery, as someone almost completely wiped out. In Franklin, I snagged some more food from Ingles (this one a slightly smaller and more limited than the Hiawassee location, but they did have Southern Butter Pecan flavored Talenti), and then treated myself to some large frappuccino-like monstrosity at Brooklyn Bagels. While I was inside, the sky opened up and it rained hard, but then stopped again just when it was time to leave. I don‚Äôt think I understand southern weather patterns just yet. I brought my sandwich and frappe back to the gazebo and found a place to charge my phone, having an early lunch with some of other hikers I met on the sidewalk today.</p>\n<p>My original plan was to enjoy town, maybe hang out with some of the peeps from the shelter last night, but after a few hours passed and I had already accomplished my town chores (food to pack out, food to wolf down), I decided to jump on the 12pm shuttle back to Rock Gap. Kind of a bummer, because around an hour later, I finally got a text from Dying about meeting up at 5:30pm.</p>\n<p>As I was getting off the shuttle, I saw that guy from Standing Indian who had made such a fuss about bear safety. (Austin told me later that, while he spent a good 40 minutes looking for a good branch to hang his food, Fussbucket‚Äînot a real trail name‚Äîhung his from the weakest branch just a few feet off the ground.) I was so fixed on making eye contact with him that I missed my footing and slipped down the shuttle stairs in the same way that this morning‚Äôs hikers had. ‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù said Fussbucket in a manner that in no way communicated any concern for my safety, and I picked myself up and walked past him, back to the trail. Not 5 minutes later, after the shuttle departed with Fussbucket on his way into town, his friend (the kind one of the two) showed up, out of breath, wondering if I had seen his friend. I had to inform him that he had just left a few minutes before ‚Äî turns out that this guy busted his butt to make the shuttle, and Fussbucket couldn‚Äôt be bothered to wait 5 minutes. And technically, this guy was on time, as the shuttle left some 3 minutes early. Poor guy.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Austin. This morning was maybe the last time I‚Äôll see him, and I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to say goodbye. He‚Äôs an ex-Marine whose wife died of breast cancer just a short while before he came out on the trail- it was kind of the forcing factor for him to come out here at all. He had already booked an Alaskan cruise some time later this summer with his dad, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll see him again. He continued on this morning to meet his dad at Winding Stair Gap, and now he could be anywhere.</p>\n<p>The weather continued to hedge between being rainy and stormy, until finally it decided to really storm. The wind was whipping at my shell, and I just focused on keeping my head down and moving forward. Whereas last night‚Äôs shelter was large and sturdy, tonight‚Äôs shelter was packed like sardines. Storm volunteered for everyone to make space for me, but I could tell I wasn‚Äôt going to fit and so I waited for a break in the rain to set up my tent. And now I‚Äôm writing this while it‚Äôs thundering and lightning-ing; I thought this spot might be well protected from the wind, but my little tent is still getting hammered. This is definitely the first ‚ÄúType 2 fun‚Äù day. Sometimes I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually out here on the trail ‚Äî I‚Äôm maybe a bit worried that it won‚Äôt sink in until I‚Äôm done.

I really need to get better at getting up and out earlier. Storm was the only one still in the shelter, huddled invisible underneath a sleeping bag. The blue blaze out of shelter was rock and mud and a bit annoying to navigate, but once the path crossed the AT and headed straight up to Siler Bald, it got a bit easier, if you don‚Äôt mind steep. I saw two guys take their packs off to lighten their load as they walked up the hill, but I made a point (for no good reason at all) of trying to catch up to them while wearing mine. I did not expect one of the guys to be Austin. Austin introduced me to Siesta, who he had met hiking out of Winding Stair Gap yesterday.</p>\n<p>Side note: Siler Bald Shelter is connected to the AT via the Siler Bald Trail, looping in both directions. Don‚Äôt tell anyone, but instead of walking south on the Siler Bald Trail to reconnect to where I had left the AT, I walked north instead, and in doing so, missed about a half mile of the AT. Please don‚Äôt tell anyone.</p>\n<p>The top of Wayah Bald seemed like a good lunch spot for Austin, Siesta, and me. It has a cool observation tower, you can see for miles. As we sat there on the north side of the tower to escape the wind, it started snowing ‚Äî actually, it was sleet! And it was still super windy, so it was blowing everywhere, truly wild. Really fun to hike through, especially as it didn‚Äôt accumulate.</p>\n<p>My original plan today was to stop at Cold Spring Shelter, but when I got there, I just didn‚Äôt like the vibe. As I refilled my water, Siesta caught up to me, and we chatted about where to end up. He was planning on pushing on to Wesser Bald Shelter, another 6 miles up trail, to put us in a good place to get to the NOC tomorrow and then the Smokies. That‚Äôd be a long day, but I felt that I could do it. And we did do it! Siesta‚Äôs fast, though. I feel like I‚Äôve been able to offset my late morning starts by walking around 2.7 miles and hour, sometimes a bit more, but I‚Äôm barely keeping up with Siesta.

He was right and I was wrong, so I‚Äôm glad I found out then before getting too far.</p>\n<p>This morning‚Äôs hike was really cool. Right after the shelter, the trail is on the ridgeline, but still mostly in the trees. And then, a switchback brings you out of the trees and gives you a view of the entire valley. It was an amazing view, up there with Franconia Ridge, and I‚Äôm bummed I didn‚Äôt get a picture (there was someone behind me).</p>\n<p>At the base of Wesser Bald is another milestone, the Nantahala Outdoor Center or NOC. As soon as I get there, I see Hitman, who I met the other day at the same shelter as Storm. I told him I came from Wesser Bald Shelter, and he says, ‚ÄúOh, the norovirus shelter?‚Äù Apparently someone had thrown up in the shelter a few days before, and that makes the four of us who stayed there exposed. Great.</p>\n<p>The NOC seems mostly like a tourist spot for white water rafters and the like, but I was able to eat a full breakfast, get some laundry done, print out my Smokies permit, and charge my electronics. Austin showed up, and we hung out a bit ‚Äî he was meeting someone to buy a tent replacement for the tarp system he was using. We grabbed a late lunch, but then it was time for me to move on, as the next shelter was 7 miles away, all up hill. I‚Äôve been going faster than Austin the last few days and I get the sense that he wants me to slow down a bit and stay at a similar pace, but he‚Äôll be off trail soon and I feel like I want to cover more ground. Technically there are some hotels or motels around here, but they cater to white water rafting tourists who are here to spend money, and that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for.</p>\n<p>While I was charging my electronics, I checked my email and saw that I had a letter from the Green Mountain Club ‚Äî they were looking for potential panelists to help give a zoom info session about their experiences on the Long Trail. I had seen an email in March about it and even started filling out an application, but stopped when I tried answering the question of what I would bring to the panel; <em>‚ÄúDear GMC, I would bring to the table the unique perspective of a white dude from Massachusetts. Please include me in your panel!‚Äù</em> But today, the GMC reached out to me specifically, noting that I had indicated after finishing the trail that I‚Äôd be excited about sharing my experiences, and asked if I‚Äôd be interested in discussing it. I let them know that, yes I‚Äôm interested, but given that I‚Äôm out here on the AT, that could either be a really interesting perspective or a really gnarly scheduling exercise. I guess we‚Äôll see what happens.</p>\n<p>I said a final goodbye as Austin‚Äôs tent connection showed up. It was getting on 3:30pm at this point, and I was doing some quick calculations. Sunset‚Äôs at 8pm, but tent spots fill up before then, and I‚Äôd have to beat 2 miles per hour just to make it before 7pm so that I wasn‚Äôt eating dinner in the dark. Normally I‚Äôve been getting 2.7 or 2.8 miles per hour but not uphill. I finished right around 6pm, so I think that put me around 2.7 miles per hour, going up hill! And I saw my first snake on trail: it was a black snake, and I think we both gave each other a good scare.

And I got a trail name!!!</p>\n<p>About an hour into the trail, I saw a big body of water barely visible through the trees, and as I descended the hill, it became clearer: this was Fontana Lake. Along the way, I saw purple flowers (an iris?) poking out of the ground ‚Äî Spring was doing its thing! Most of Georgia was some form of monochromatic brown, and while the cooler temperatures have been great to hike through, I‚Äôm looking forward to a bit more color. I got to Fontana Dam Road just after 11am, where there was a tiny building with a set of bathroom stalls and a power outlet. I charged my electronics while I waited for a shuttle to bring me into Fontana Village, where I‚Äôd get my first mail drop.</p>\n<p>Before I started the trail, I did a google search for ‚Äútrail towns with the worst resupply‚Äù, and Fontana Village came up high in the results. As the only resupply spot around before the Smokies, prices can get pretty high, and we‚Äôre out of Ingles territory now. Having read about this ahead of time, I coordinated with family back home to send dehydrated meals, clif bars, and a Talenti jar (this was before I snagged some from Franklin) to the Fontana Village post office. The pickup process at the post office was smooth, and when I saw the prices in the general store, I was really happy with my decision to send food by mail! I bought the dehydrated food in bulk during a Black Friday sale, paying around $9/serving, and most of the meals in the general store were around $20. Even though it cost almost $20 to ship food from Boston, it was well worth it.</p>\n<p>After I repacked my bag, I walked down to the Pit Stop, a gas station that also serves chili dogs, and grabbed some food. The guy who drove our shuttle (trail name of ‚ÄòShua, or Joshua) came in, grabbed a hot dog, and sat next to me, and we got talking. Toward the end, he asked me my name, and I gave my stock answer of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a trail name yet‚Äù *hint hint*, and this time, he suggested <em>Marathon</em>. Marathon? I asked‚Äîhad I told him that I ran Boston during the pandemic year? I couldn‚Äôt remember‚Äîand he replied about it being such an iconic piece of Boston. It was perfect, not because I had run Boston 4 years ago, but because I needed to remind myself that this was a marathon and not a sprint, because I had been pushing myself hard these past few days but I needed to remember to enjoy it, and not push my body to points of exhaustion like I felt I had done at times on the Long Trail.</p>\n<p>One thing ‚ÄòShua said that stuck with me (and I don‚Äôt remember the context, but it still stands alone):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all in the same boat, but there‚Äôs a leak in one end, and we‚Äôre just content to move over to the end that‚Äôs sticking further up.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dam(n), it‚Äôs good to be out here.</p>\n<p>A short while later, ‚ÄòShua drove me and the others back to Fontana Dam Road, and I hiked the 1.5 miles to my destination for the night, Fontana Dam Shelter. What a spot! Also known as the ‚ÄúFontana Hilton‚Äù, it had showers and an industrial-sized solar charging station. Pretty gorgeous views of the lake. And there was a good crew: Hitman, and Thomas and Kyler, and Terminator, and a whole bunch of people I hadn‚Äôt met before but seemed awesome. Strider, who had started months before me and almost sheltered at my house in Boston before finding better accommodations, had arrived here as well, and he had great news: I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to norovirus after all! Apparently, he was the author of the comment in FarOut about someone throwing up in the shelter at Wesser Bald, but he found out later that it was due to food poisoning. I was healthy after all! The Icelandic couple I had met in Franklin showed up, and apparently the guy had enjoyed a Wendy‚Äôs experience so much, he acquired a trail name of Baconator. I met Live Mas, who was from the area and knew so much about the Smokies (and why we had to pay $40 to walk through it). Today was my first shower on the trail, and I needed it. I walked only 6 or 7 miles today, but today was a good day. We‚Äôll see what the Smokies brings.</p>\n<p>I also had a chance to connect with Lorne from the Green Mountain Club about being a panelist for the Long Trail information session. He asked me a few questions, like when I hiked, and whether I had gone to college; I told him that one of the things I liked best about the Long Trail was how narrow the mountain range was, and how this made it very easy to see just where you were coming from (the easily visible mountain just south) and where you were going (the easily visible mountain just north). The mountains weren‚Äôt just points on a map, but your past and your future. This was just maybe a better answer than ‚ÄúI enjoyed a mud hellscape, mostly without views. A++ type two fun, would maybe never do again.‚Äù I told him I was excited to be on the panel, and while I was a bit concerned about logistics of finding internet along the trail, I was willing to try to make it work.

Instead of walking in the mountains at around 4000 or 5000 feet above sea level, I walked over the dam today at around 1700 feet above sea level. Immediately following the dam, there were National Park Service signs for ‚ÄúGreat Smoky Mountains National Park‚Äù, and shortly after that, the box to deposit the entry portion of my Smokies permit. The way the permit system works is, you print out your permit ahead of time, rip it in half, stick half of it in a box upon entering, and stick the other half in a box upon exiting. I‚Äôm not sure how often they collect the permits, but this morning the entry box was full.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not really sure what to expect from hiking through a National Park ‚Äî I kind of feel like it should be an even more pristine form of nature than I‚Äôve been hiking through so far.</p>\n<p>Today was my first chance to go up a fire tower on a clear day, and I took it. Two years ago, on an overnight hike in Vermont, I walked right by a fire tower on top of Stratton Mountain, and when I went up Stratton again while on the Long Trail this past year, it was socked in with no chance of views. It left an imprint that opportunities are finite and fleeting and unpredictable, and I resolved to climb every fire tower I could if it were a clear day. Shuckstack gave me my first choice, and while it didn‚Äôt disappoint, it was maybe a bit‚Ä¶ too much. A few days ago, coming down into the NOC, the view unfolded and revealed itself like a story, but the view from Shuckstack was a bit like that at the Grand Canyon, where you‚Äôre presented with all of it all at once, with no build-up or release of dramatic tension. I‚Äôm not disappointed! just a bit overwhelmed. There‚Äôs just so much.</p>\n<p>I saw Hitman having lunch at Mollies Ridge and stopped to grab a snack, but kept moving after a few minutes when I got sick of the flies surrounding the campfire pit.

Maybe hiking through a national park <em>will</em> show me an even more pristine form of nature than I‚Äôve seen so far.</p>\n<p>I got to Russell Field, my home for the night, and it was covered by a tarp. The same was true with Mollies Ridge shelter, I‚Äôm not sure what the deal is. To protect against bears? To protect from high winds at high elevation? Unknown.

Dema walked by, exclaiming ‚ÄúHi Liam!‚Äù, and I shouted back, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Marathon now!‚Äù I no longer answer to <em>‚ÄúLiam‚Äù</em>. Forklift and Mosey were there too, and Forklift let me take some pictures of her tree identification book. Each page had a picture of leaf patterns, a picture of bark patterns, and paragraphs about identification and habitat. It‚Äôs been an objective of mine to learn how to identify trees while I‚Äôm out here, and now I‚Äôd be armed with real knowledge.

I‚Äôm pretty sure this isn‚Äôt supposed to be a thing? I think Kyler recorded it on video. Nobody knew how long the meat had been sitting in his pack either. He also had chicken, that he was keeping cool by storing it in the water supply (in plastic packaging)? He said he was hiking the IAT (International AT), which I think extends to Florida and Newfoundland (at least, on this continent) ‚Äî he credits a high meat and fish oil diet. I guess diet is highly personal, which is fine, but when he started burning the trash (‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs bad but it‚Äôs better than leaving it for the bears‚Äù) and leaving leftover tinfoil in the stove for others to clean up, I was frustrated.

Last week at Siler Bald, Storm left a cantaloupe on the table, and I asked her if she could take care of it, she said she had finished with it, and it wasn‚Äôt her responsibility anymore. When I left the next morning, it was in the middle of the trail.

This is a little bit of a bummer, as I already have a mail drop on its way to Standing Bear, but I can still pay $5 to pick it up without staying, and they never got back to me when I texted them the other day about renting a bunk.

And it wasn‚Äôt even that hard. The top of Clingmans Dome has a concrete observation tower, and we were there bright and early (with only a small crowd of people who were there before us, the Smokies are the most popular park in the country and this might be its most popular destination) to see the sun diffuse through heavy clouds. I heard later that the clouds melted off by 9am or so, and if we had just gotten up at a normal hour, we would have had a better view (not to mention a better sleep), but doing things reasonably is for suckers. If I wanted to do things reasonably, would I really be out here in the first place?</p>\n<p>The observation tower in the books, we walked down the road toward the visitor center as everyone else is planning on doing some road miles. I misheard Brightside as having said there was a vending machine, and soon everyone in the group was full-on expecting it to exist. When we reached the visitor center and it wasn‚Äôt even open yet, I was only partly devastated. We had breakfast on the stone wall behind the parking lot bathrooms, and it was time to part ways, though I wasn‚Äôt nervous as I was pretty sure I‚Äôd see at least a few people later on today or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>The rest of the morning was kind of beautiful, as I walked out of one forest and into another: somewhat dramatically, I stopped seeing trees of one type and started seeing trees of another. I really do need to get better at identifying trees, though I want to say I walked into a variety of pines. There was just enough mist and fog floating through the trees to give it an air of magic. There was also a literal fence enclosure, or exclosure: apparently, wild hogs had been decimating the beech population, so they created a fence to keep the hogs out, and it‚Äôs wild to see so many beech trees growing in such a small, specific slice of land.</p>\n<p>When I got to Newfound Gap, I saw Hitman in a group trying to get a hitch to Gatlinburg ‚Äî he was tired and wanted a break, but I selfishly was hoping just a bit not to lose people just yet. It was my own choice too, as they asked me if I wanted to come along, but I wanted to keep the inertia going. After they scored a ride a minute or two later, I sat down to trail magic and rested up just a bit.</p>\n<p>Walking out of Newfound Gap, I spotted my first sign for Katahdin! I also spotted a noticeable difference in walking speed between me and the day hikers. Of course the one woman who was closest to keeping up with my speed was a retiree from Colorado, the state where outdoorsy people go to live outdoors.</p>\n<p>Later on, I caught up with Chris, and I was relieved; I thought everyone I knew had left, and I was alone again on the AT. We met a friend of Tarzan‚Äôs chilling out at Icewater Shelter, who made an empathetic case for him. There‚Äôs always another side to someone, and one of Tarzan‚Äôs other sides is that he likes carrying things as ballast, including dog food. I don‚Äôt remember Tarzan‚Äôs friend‚Äôs name, but I do remember that her dog‚Äôs name was Cujo, and that Cujo scared away 3 bears at Russell Field shelter a few nights back.</p>\n<p>Chris and I carried on. We checked out Charlies Bunion and took pictures, but soon I started to outpace him; there‚Äôs this constant battle in me between wanting to be social and make friends on trail, and wanting to burn miles, and I feel best about my body on trail when I‚Äôm pushing it forward. Today was my first day getting to 20 miles, and my legs and lungs were happy about it, though my feet were pretty tired. I got to Peck‚Äôs Corner ahead of Chris, and again I was a stranger to everyone in the shelter. Someone in the shelter had an equipment emergency, their hipbelt having attempted to run away from their pack, and I was able to lend them my sowing kit. I don‚Äôt even know how to use it myself (I‚Äôm convinced I could figure out if I had to), but I‚Äôm glad to see it‚Äôs going to good use.

It was 6:45pm when I rolled into Roaring Fork, and the shelter was full, but I snagged one of the last tent spots before heading back to the shelter‚Äôs picnic table to make my dinner.</p>\n<p>Someone asked me where I was from, and when I said ‚ÄúBoston‚Äù, it turned out that there was another person in the shelter from Boston ‚Äî and from Jamaica Plain, no less! This was total deja vu for me, after the same thing happened to me on the Long Trail. It turns out that Snail Mail lives in the Forest Hills area, which is only 2 T stops away from me. Also, it turns out that one of Snail Mail‚Äôs friends did the Long Trail the year before I did! And somehow remembers more of it than I did. I spent my whole dinner chatting about the LT, which at ~275 miles, is still the longest hike I‚Äôve ever been on.

And again, I was the last one out of camp this morning. Not like I had far to go ‚Äî it was almost exactly 3 miles downhill from Deer Park Shelter to Hot Springs NC, and I took more or less the whole thing at a trot, trending toward canter. I‚Äôve discovered that different knees prefer different trail directions; one of my knees has a harder time with going uphill while the other one has a harder time going down. But I‚Äôve discovered that, if I land with my forefoot, going downhill gets a bit easier. So I‚Äôve adopted this gait sometimes where one foot lands on the forefoot while the other lands on the heel. Human bodies are weird, human bodies walking all day every day are weirder. Whatever works, works.</p>\n<p>I had booked my own personal room at the hostel, and checked in around 9:30am. After I put my stuff down, I looked on the map for the nearest coffee shop. But not just any shop that sells coffee. During one town stop on the Long Trail, I bought myself an affogato, and it was <em>delicious</em>. The milkfat is also probably important too. So now when I‚Äôm in town, I search for the coffee shop that‚Äôs most likely to have an espresso machine, and hopefully some ice cream to go with it.</p>\n<p>Hot Springs is a really lovely little trail town, with a main drag that runs for just a few blocks. Laughing Heart was at one end, and so I started out toward coffee, which I never drink while on the trail (it takes too much time and wastes a boil) but is a trail town staple for me. After walking just a block or so (the trail itself goes right down the main street!), I saw Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and Honeybuns walking toward me; they also had gotten their rooms settled, and were headed to the diner for breakfast. I planned to hit up the diner after, but I couldn‚Äôt pass up breakfast company, so I asked if I could join them, and we headed over to the Smoky Mountain Diner. After we had finished our breakfast but were still chatting, some friends of Fire Magic‚Äôs named Lost and Liberty came in and sat down with us. Lost was a tall and lanky Virginian, while Liberty resembled the me I‚Äôd aspire to in 10 years, albeit with a Scottish accent.</p>\n<p>After breakfast was chore time. But first, fancy coffee. I walked the 0.3 miles to Artisun, and DID YOU KNOW THEY HAD A PIANO?! Holy crap. After accidentally finding a piano inside the Inn at the Long Trail, I had googled a few times about which hostels along the AT might have a piano, but came up dry. And here I was at a random coffee shop in North Carolina, and they had a piano. After getting my coffee, I asked the barista if I could borrow their piano, and they were happy to lend it. I spent a good chunk of time either playing old songs or just capturing the mood.</p>\n<p>After a little while it was time to get some real chores done. I noticed this morning that my water bottle and filter was missing in action, so I looked into the Outfitter to see if they might carry the same one, but they didn‚Äôt have the bottle in the same size, so I bought a pair of trail gaiters instead. (I‚Äôll always miss my Dirty Girl gaiters, and I‚Äôll never forgive Topo for making a proprietary gaiter system. But here I am, giving it a shot.) I grabbed some mediocre food options from a picked-over Dollar General, and headed back to Laughing Heart to get some laundry done. Their loaner clothes were infinitely more interesting than the oversized tees of the Inn at the Long Trail, and I pared a camoflage henley with a pair of purple capri pants that fit perfectly; ‚Äúthe bottoms for when I want to be seen, and the top for when I don‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Going back to search for my water filter would add 6 miles to my day, which was a bummer, but I‚Äôd have to do it. But while I was chatting with someone at the hostel about having lost it, the hostel‚Äôs caretaker overheard me and asked what kind it was ‚Äî apparently, Numbers had seen my bottle along the trail and rescued it. The chances of someone else spotting it, deciding to pick it up, deciding to carry it north, and deciding to bring it to this hostel out of all places, must be pretty slim, but the trail does provide.</p>\n<p>With time now left on the day, I headed back to Artisun to purchase a sugary excuse to sit down at the piano again. Honeybuns came in and saw me, and (unbeknownst to me in the moment) grabbed a video of me playing. Later that day, Honeybuns told me that there was a chapel at Laughing Heart that had a piano, so (almost immediately) I went to check it out. I noodled on one of the progressions I was playing with at Artisun, and a lyric came to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is who we are <br>\nIn the fields, in the bars <br>\nIn the streets, in the cars <br>\nIn the roots, in the fire <br>\nAnd all that we need in the world is to see our reflection</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the Long Trail, I had an idea to create a musical project, ‚Äúwind river highway‚Äù, inspired by time on the trail, but nothing came of it. I think my problem was that the Long Trail was only 273 miles, and inspiration apparently doesn‚Äôt come until mile 274.9.</p>\n<p>I stayed up a bit late tonight, using the hostel wifi to join my normal Monday night hang out with friends ‚Äúback home‚Äù, and by back home I mean Georgia, DC, PA, NY‚Ä¶ we usually chat from around 7pm to 8pm and then watch a movie together, and now even 8pm feels late for me. On one hand it was good to update them on how the trail has been, on the other it was nice just to fade into the background and be part of a conversation among old friends, even if I did have a harder time relating to the details of city life than I would have just a month ago or so.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Deer Park Mountain Shelter","end":272}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":21,"date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Spring Mountain Shelter","end":286.2,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"üôÇ","sleepScore":32,"garminFeedback":"FIND_TIME_TO_RELAX","trainingReadiness":30},"html":"<p>Of course I stopped by Artisun for a departing coffee/piano visit. Chris walked up as I was enjoying my drink, and we hung out a bit before I moved on ‚Äî it turns out that Chris is a climber. He said he was meeting up with friends when he got to New Hampshire, so I told him to go visit Rumney. I wonder though, at least for myself, whether I‚Äôd have any arm strength by the time I get there. Town stops like this are great for calories, but I can feel my body redistributing itself as I spend more calories than I carry. I weighed myself at the hostel this morning: 146 pounds. I don‚Äôt remember exactly how much I weighed before I left, but I‚Äôm going to guess I‚Äôve lost maybe 5 pounds so far.</p>\n<p>I crushed the ascent out of Hot Springs today! Along the sidewalk of Hot Springs itself are diamond-shaped AT markers embedded into the concrete sidewalk, but almost immediately after Artisun, over the bridge, the trail takes a hard right and hugs the river for a bit. And after a nice scenic river view, it goes <em>up</em>, and with a full stomach, I attacked it. After a few hours I caught up to Snail Mail and Fire Magic and we hiked together a bit, taking a little detour to check out a fire tower. Two for two on fire tower opportunities! This one was great, too ‚Äî no rickety steps, and the top was enclosed and protected from the wind. We stayed up there for maybe an hour, looking out and chatting. A local Tennesseean came up for the view, and we chatted with him a bit. One thing I remember him saying, he mentioned seeing some hikers speeding down the trail, somewhat oblivious of their surroundings, and he couldn‚Äôt understand why someone wouldn‚Äôt slow down just a bit and enjoy the outdoors. I‚Äôve been trying to strike a balance with nature the whole time I‚Äôve been out here, and I told him that once you‚Äôve been out here for a few months, the trees start to blend into each other. Sometimes the thing that‚Äôs beautiful is not this particular tree in all its glory, but the comparison of these trees to those completely different trees you saw last week, some 100 miles back. He nodded as if to empathize, but I can tell he bears a strong preference for being able to appreciate the trees in front of him. Personally I wonder a bit if a thru hiker is cursed to lose the ability to enjoy the thing they came out here for, but so far I still feel like I‚Äôm net positive.</p>\n<p>We got to the shelter by around 5pm. A few days ago, I covered 3 or 4 shelters in a day, and today, I took 2 days to get from one shelter to the next. It all comes out in the wash. Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and I found spots to pitch our tents and grabbed some dinner at the picnic table. Snail Mail got her trail name from the care packages she gets, as she‚Äôs taken the mail drop option for resupply. Her family is doing a lot to personalize each drop, which sounds awesome.

There was a policy of 1 free cookie, $2 for any additional ‚Äî I won‚Äôt say how many cookies I ate, but it was the right amount. We also passed Big Butt Bypass toward the end of the day (the side trail names for this area are really getting me), and surpassed the 300 mile mark! There was the number 300 spelled out in a rock formation on the ground to mark the spot, and we managed to grab a photo of the milestone.</p>\n<p>At the shelter, Fire Magic reunited with Lost. Lost said that Fire Magic kept him going on the trail for a bit. It‚Äôs crazy how hikers intersect, separate, and come back together. Around the picnic table at dinner, I mentioned something about ursacks as I‚Äôm planning to switch to one in Virginia, and a dude in a kilt sitting around the fire interjected. Apparently his ursack was destroyed by the bear at Standing Indian, ripped at the seam, and he thinks now that ursacks are a ripoff. I was torn between feeling a bit sorry for this guy for having lost his food, and thinking that hanging an ursack to a tree at a shelter with a known bear problem was kind of a bad idea to begin with. I‚Äôm looking forward to swapping my big bulky heavy bear canister for an ursack when I get further north, but ursacks aren‚Äôt great protection against habituated bears. The dude was clearly mad so I didn‚Äôt push it, but Lost made a point of saying, you‚Äôre in the bear‚Äôs home, you can‚Äôt really be mad at him. Dude‚Äôs still mad, though I was happy to hear Lost say it.</p>\n<p>Phoenix, a German woman we had met yesterday hiking with her friend Fire, arrived and came in with us in the shelter, saving some space for Fire who should arrive shortly. But as bedtime came and Fire didn‚Äôt, I could sense Phoenix was concerned. With everyone else in the shelter sleeping or on their way, Phoenix sat upright, anxiously sighing and looking at her phone. I asked her from underneath my quilt if she was nervous about her friend; yes, she said, Fire should have arrived by now. They were carrying one inReach between them, and Phoenix was the one carrying it. She got a text a few hours ago, but hadn‚Äôt heard anything recently, and there wasn‚Äôt enough signal here to get a message out. I told her that if she decided she‚Äôd like to hike back to look for her, I‚Äôd be happy to walk with her. She took me up on the offer, and soon everyone in the shelter was awake, transitioning from sleeping shelter mates to willing search party members. I made a point of bringing my first aid kit with me, wondering how much I remembered from my wilderness first aid 2-day class. Luckily, we hadn‚Äôt hiked more than a half mile or so before Phoenix exclaimed that she had enough signal to send a message; a few minutes later, texts were exchanged with Fire, and it turned out that she had lost her way earlier, but was closing in on the shelter soon. A few minutes after that, we could see her headlamp in the distance, and there was a brief tearful reunion with hugs to go around. I was glad, mostly for Phoenix but also just happy not to have to discover just how much of my first aid training I had forgotten.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Spring Mountain Shelter","end":286.2}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":23,"date":"2024-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Bald Mountain Shelter","end":327.7,"sleep":"Shelter","mood":"üôÇ","sleepScore":66,"garminFeedback":"LISTEN_TO_YOUR_BODY","trainingReadiness":31},"html":"<p>There were happy goodbyes this morning as Phoenix and Fire were together again. Phoenix complimented me by calling me a dancer, and when I misunderstood and said that no, I‚Äôm not a dancer, she explained that I appear to dance when coming down the trail with my trekking poles. I took this as high praise, as I never really hiked with trekking poles before last year, and I‚Äôve been working to get used to them.</p>\n<p>Fire Magic and I started the day out together, and hiked together for some of the first few miles. There was some really awesome trail magic around 3 miles in at Devil‚Äôs Fork, where I was able to grab some fresh fruit and bars but also snag some really well wrapped toilet paper. I stayed for maybe 30 minutes, waiting for one snack to digest before tearing into the next one, and talking so some of the really nice folks running the trail magic stand.</p>\n<p>I almost caught up to Fire Magic again (this time with Lost), as they were leaving yet another trail magic stop 12 miles in just as I was arriving. I‚Äôll never refuse food, and an orange was definitely a welcome interruption. The trail angel asked me what my number was, referring to the number on my hang tag, and when I told him, he said he hadn‚Äôt seen anyone with a number that high yet. The numbers are sequential, so someone starting on January 1st might be #1 while I, starting on April 3rd, was 1961. The higher your number at any given spot, the faster you‚Äôre probably going relative to those around you, and most of the hikers I was hiking around had lower numbers and had started sometime in March. It‚Äôs tough to know really who‚Äôs ahead and who‚Äôs behind you, but I definitely feel like I‚Äôve been going faster than a lot of people I‚Äôve met.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, I had caught up to Fire Magic, and we took in the peak at the top of Big Bald. It was just Fire Magic, me, and a dude sitting in a tractor, staring out into the horizon. It really was a good view, but it was starting to get a little chilly, and we decided to make the 1.2 mile trek back here as a sunrise hike. The views this time would be infinitely better than Clingmans Dome.</p>\n<p>As we ate dinner at the picnic table, a hiker came in relatively late (just before sundown) and went off immediately to set up her tent. Her name was Rabbit, and I guess she had gotten the name from hiking big miles. I thought that I had done some big days, pushing past 20 miles a few times, but Rabbit I think started after me. No sooner had I puffed out my chest for having a high hang tag number than I met someone who most likely had a higher number than me. I tried peaking at Rabbit‚Äôs hang tag when she came back just to see how high the difference was, and was a bit ashamed of myself. I imagine Rabbit will probably speed right by and that‚Äôll be that, but it was good to remind myself that there are people on all ends of things. <em>‚ÄúThis is a marathon, not a sprint.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>Fire Magic and I stayed in the shelter so that we could pack up quickly in the morning, and we were the only two there. We chatted a bit about expectations for the trail, tramilies, and a bit of my inner fight between wanting to make connections along the way and wanting to stretch my legs. Fire Magic was not creating expectations around who she might hike with or for how long, and that makes sense. Some people you don‚Äôt see for a while but then reconnect out of the blue, she said, and some people you only hike with for a day and then never see again. But then she mentioned this one time when an older guy we both knew (someone I met only briefly at Fontana Dam) behaved pretty sketchily toward a younger woman we both knew. While I‚Äôve enjoyed seeing the good and bad of people and being part of a trail community that tends to bring out the good in everyone, it was a bit disheartening to hear about the <em>other</em> side of someone who didn‚Äôt initially strike me as a bad dude, but appears now to have definitely behaved badly at times. And Fire Magic and I were both almost falling asleep by this time, but in my sleepy mind, I drew a distant parallel between that guy and myself, and wondered if Fire Magic was getting any bad behavior vibes from me. I was definitely too tired to ask or to try to redirect if that was the case, but I fell asleep with a feeling of wanting to avoid giving off the wrong impression.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Flint Mountain Shelter","end":308.8}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":24,"date":"2024-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Uncle Johnny's Hostel","end":344.5,"sleep":"Building","mood":"üôÇ","sleepScore":45,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_SLOW_DOWN","trainingReadiness":3},"html":"<p>The sunrise hike happened! It initially seemed as though it might be overcast, but we actually got some beautiful views.</p>\n<p>In my haste to get up for sunrise, I didn‚Äôt pull out any snacks for the day. A normal person would stop, take a moment to enjoy their surroundings, maybe? and take out some snacks from their pack before repacking and starting out again. But that would take too long, so I decided to bust out the first 10 miles of the day and figure out food at the first shelter. I caught up with Fire Magic at the top of the first hill, and there was a moment where she might have thought I would hike alongside her as I did the other day, but I explained poorly that I didn‚Äôt pack snacks very well so I was going to hike fast. Writing this now, I don‚Äôt think that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>Reflecting, I think there are maybe 3 reasons that I hiked fast this morning? One, because I get anxious about taking breaks when I could be moving, two, because Rabbit is an enigma and I‚Äôm curious if I could catch up to her, and three, I wonder if I may have given Fire Magic a weird impression last night. The fact that I have enough energy to get pretty poor sleep last night but still hike 10 miles without eating anything is just icing.</p>\n<p>I caught up to Rabbit just before Spivey Gap. She asked me if I saw this gigantic tree a little while back, and this interaction sticks with me because I missed it, and I conflate missing a gigantic tree with hiking too fast to notice the little (or big) things. But I guess it goes both ways, as I remarked to Rabbit about how quiet this gap was, and she said she didn‚Äôt notice on account of wearing headphones. I guess we all notice the things we notice.</p>\n<p>I passed Rabbit, but she leapfrogged me around a half mile before the shelter as I was getting water. I arrived at the first shelter and ate lunch before rearranging my pack and waited for Fire Magic to catch up. I originally anticipated hiking into Erwin with Fire Magic, but as she made her lunch, I reconsidered, wanting to get to Uncle Johnny‚Äôs soon so that I could get some chores done.</p>\n<p>While I was on the Long Trail, I saw one interaction that sort of redefined how I see thru hikers hiking together. As I was having breakfast with a guy, his friend announced he was planning to start walking for the day. The guy I was chatting with replied that he‚Äôd be ready in 20 minutes, after he finished his breakfast and hit the privy. I expected some sort of negotiation, either a ‚ÄúI can wait 20 minutes‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll eat quickly‚Äù, but instead, both did exactly what they said they were going to do, and hiked separately for the morning. I guessed that, when you‚Äôre hiking almost 2200 miles with someone, you don‚Äôt have to hike all of those miles together. But I‚Äôm a consensus-driven person by nature, and I‚Äôm still figuring out how to make decisions independently of the people around me.</p>\n<p>When I got to Uncle Johnny‚Äôs, I ran into Live Mas and Lost and caught up a bit. That bit about reconnecting with people you haven‚Äôt seen for a while is really true ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen Live Mas since I met him at the Fontana Hilton. It was still raining, so I ended up holding off on chores, but Rabbit walked the two miles into town to pick up some cork so she could hand-carve her own insoles. That‚Äôs pretty badass. Fire Magic arrived shortly thereafter, and we did laundry together. The loaner clothes here aren‚Äôt quite as cool or comfy as those at Laughing Heart, but the outdoor shower was novel and felt good.</p>\n<p>We all went out for Mexican food. I think this might be the worst Mexican food I‚Äôve had in my life, but as always I‚Äôm grateful for the calories, and the portions were large enough that I couldn‚Äôt even finish my meal. I think my hunger now outstrips the physical limitations of my stomach.</p>\n<p>Rabbit indeed does have a higher number than me, and started on April 6th. She lives in a converted school bus with oak floors, and makes her own pemican. She‚Äôs planning to do 20 to 30 miles a day. My wanting to get miles out of my body doesn‚Äôt in any way compare to her wanting to see how far she can push her body. I asked her about this war (that I‚Äôve been fighting internally) between hiking socially and hiking aggressively. She said she‚Äôd like to meet a tramily that also does similar distances, but she doesn‚Äôt want to sacrifice movement. I feel similarly, even if our ideas of pushing ourselves are scaled differently. Fire Magic is planning to take a zero day tomorrow and reconnect with Snail Mail and Honeybuns. As cool as it would be to see the both of them, I don‚Äôt want to sacrifice movement, so I guess that means sacrificing hiking with Fire Magic, Snail Mail, and Honeybuns.</p>\n<p>Talking to Live Mas, I learned that not everybody is out here for the same reasons. (Shocking.) I mean, some people see this as a vacation, and when the days get hard or the weather turns sour, and they type 1 fun isn‚Äôt happening, they take a rest day and have fun off trail instead. I guess that makes sense, but if you wanted a vacation, why not a cruise, or hike the Camino de Santiago where your gear and meals are taken care of, instead of hiking with your tent on your back for 2200 miles? I came out here because home life is far too comfortable, and I want to be comfortable being uncomfortable. But we‚Äôre all out here for different reasons, at different life stages.</p>\n<p>We had this conversation in conjunction with my decision to tent in the rain, instead of staying in the bunks.

After getting back to Uncle Johnny‚Äôs and repacking my bag, I finally left the hostel at 3pm.</p>\n<p>The last time I left this late in the day, it was 7 miles uphill out of the NOC. And honestly, when I got to the first shelter some 4.5 miles in, I thought I might stop there for the day. But then when I arrived, I chatted with some section hikers that had planned to finish the day at Beauty Spot, another 6.5 miles in. I had read about Beauty Spot! I had even saved an article to my phone that said, if you‚Äôre going to camp anywhere on the AT, make sure to stop at Beauty Spot, where you can see both a great sunset and sunrise from your tent. I grabbed some water, and did some quick mental calculations, but that took too long so I just started walking and ran the numbers while on foot. It was 4:45pm, which left me relatively 3 hours or so to make 6.5 miles. And how many people might be there? It was a Saturday night, and the article said that this was a popular spot with the locals. I‚Äôd have to get there with enough time to find a good tent spot and get dinner before settling down to watch the sunset.</p>\n<p>Toward the last climb, I could feel the wind howling. I made it to the summit before 7pm, almost perfect timing, and I was surprised to see only 2 or 3 other tents there. Rereading the FarOut comments, it seemed as though maybe Beauty Spot used to be a spot where you could order delivery pizza, but now the roads here were closed. Sorry, locals! It was still windy, but one of the other tenters told me that, if I camp right next to a certain fire ring, the wind was significantly dampened by some trees. And so I set up tent where they mentioned, and enjoyed one of my finer ramen noodle packets under a beautiful sunset. I thought about the definition of luck. Before getting on trail, luck was when preparation meets opportunity, but now that I‚Äôm out here and I‚Äôve prepared as much as I can, luck to me is an awareness of those opportunities and the flexibility to meet them. I was tired when I got to the shelter today, but as soon as I heard the section hikers talking about Beauty Spot, I wasn‚Äôt so set in stopping there that I couldn‚Äôt pivot.

I chilled for a bit with Salamander, who I saw hike past Yellow Springs last night, saying he wanted to give night hiking a try. A hiker named Hero had collected a number of mushrooms and used them to create a tea. He offered it to all of us, and although it‚Äôs probably not the brightest idea to trust complete strangers about mushroom picking, I gave it a try. More or less tasted exactly how I thought mushroom tea might taste, and I haven‚Äôt died yet.</p>\n<p>I know some other hikers have mailed their used up shoes home as a sort of souvenir. I threw mine in the trash. I had a moment of sadness, such a cruel fate for a pair of shoes that supported me for over half the trail, but they served me well, and they had no purpose left in them. I thanked them for their service and threw them out.</p>\n<p>Before I even got to the hostel, I put my old shoes through their last set of paces, passing through a marshy spot that was flooded due to beaver activity. It was a fun balancing act and puzzle all in one, how to get from one end to the other without getting wet. I did accidentally dip my foot in partially, but overall managed to stay dry for the most part.</p>\n<p>I landed at the end of the day at the 501 Shelter. This is supposed to be kind of an iconic shelter, where you can have pizza delivered, but I arrived pretty late because I was waiting for my shoes and didn‚Äôt get out of Swatara until almost 5pm. I caught up to Martian in the last few miles, and she didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd make it in time to order pizza, so I told her I‚Äôd order for her. But by the time I got there, daylight was fading, and when I tried to put in an order for pizza, they said they didn‚Äôt deliver after 8:30pm. <em>It was 8:31pm.</em> A few minutes later, Martian came in, and I felt bad that I didn‚Äôt arrive in time to put in an order for her.</p>\n<p>Bonk and DK, who I saw at a shelter the other day, offered us some of their leftovers.

As he was talking through it, he was narrating his own need to find a target to blame, some cause for why bad things happen to good people. The only potential cause he could put words to was the Chinese, saying that the timing wasn‚Äôt too far off from the weather balloon incident.

Today was an exercise in ‚Äúdon‚Äôt overthink it‚Äù, as the trail literally goes right by a deli called ‚ÄúAppalachian Market‚Äù.

I ran into Freedom and Dax while I chilled out for a while.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs still hot, but not quite as hot during the day as it was when I was in New Jersey, and I was able to make decent time. I‚Äôve been using the log books to see how far ahead of me people are, and I opened a log book expecting to find a sign-in sheet, but found individual cards instead, and felt compelled to write poetry. I think I said something like,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the universe but dying, <br>\nBut it‚Äôs ours, if only for this moment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or something like that.

She‚Äôs writing a book about how the politics of division (the division of politics?) is biological, baked into our lower level thinking that seeks to compartmentalize. I ordered a pizza because I could, but there was so much food here, I didn‚Äôt manage to finish my side, and ended up giving the rest to a guy named Bridger. The maintainer stopped by and had a question for the group: do they think people are nice? Apparently he asks this question of a lot people, and while most say yes, a fair percentage of people say that others would answer no. I suppose that‚Äôs an interesting observation. Sparx thanked him for doing such a good job making RPH such a cool shelter to stay at, and mentioned that she‚Äôd like to do more trail magic here, which kicked off a long conversation/disagreement between the two over whether this is ok or not. It seems like the maintainer is more or less saying that doing trail magic at RPH falls into the law of unexpected consequences, and that there‚Äôs a significant chance that someone else might do a similar thing but without the good will and intention of cleaning up after themselves, ending up diminishing the things that make RPH a great shelter to begin with. After he left, most of the other hikers were mad at the maintainer, as Sparx‚Äôs actions had been well-intentioned and she was responsible about cleaning up after the group. But I think I side with the maintainer: the hikers moving along the trail never get the perspective of seeing how a single place changes with different hikers‚Äô passing.</p>\n<p>The privy here smells absolutely terrible, but the artwork and ambiance makes up for it.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Fort Montgomery","end":1410.3}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":85,"date":"2024-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Edward R Murrow Park, Pawling, NY","end":1451.9,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"üôÇ","sleepScore":47,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":16},"html":"<p><em>DELI BLAZING IS AMAZING.</em> I was so concerned about the logistics of deli blazing, but it‚Äôs pretty simple: every day, plan on having at least one meal at a deli.

I remember writing off the Smokies as ‚Äúthanks for the $40, here‚Äôs your tarp‚Äù but I think there‚Äôs something dangerous about this tourist mentality of a thru hiker, walking through cultures without being part of them.

I stayed at LotC until just before 9am for free breakfast leftovers, then ate SO MUCH at Mt Washington visitors center. I got there before 10am, but they didn‚Äôt start serving pizza/lunch until later, so I ended up going back for multiple meals. I don‚Äôt even want to know how much I paid. It was windy, cloudy, and a bit rainy when I first arrived, but the clouds cleared up after a meal or two, so I went out and got my summit photo a second time. I also texted with Ted, and he said he‚Äôd come pick me up from Katahdin! Logistics win!</p>\n<p>I remember going up Clingmans Dome and thinking, ‚Äúthis is so easy, wait until we get to Mount Washington!‚Äù but this morning was by far the easiest ascent up Mount Washington I‚Äôve experienced. It helps a lot that it was only a mile and a half. That was the easy part; the rest of the day was basically a long descent, punctuated by lesser Presidentials.</p>\n<p>Today was the Seek the Peak fundraiser, so the trail was <em>crowded</em>. The AT avoids the actual peaks for most of the Presis, and I‚Äôm kind of glad it does, as the peak bypass sections of the trail were far less crowded. I‚Äôm glad that folks are getting out here on the trail for their weekend, but the amount of stop-and-go action around the Presis got to be a bit brutal. It was also basically just 7 miles of fairly dangerous rockstacles (rock obstacles? going with it), so most of the day hikers were taking their time, rightly so, and I didn‚Äôt want to just breeze past them.</p>\n<p>Also, did I mention that this section of trail is tough?! This was a long 10 miles. I remember though hiking a section last year close to Mount Adams on a MITOC day hike, and telling hikers that I too planned to hike the AT soon enough. Now here I am.</p>\n<p>I took a breather at the Madison Spring Hut, to grab some lemonade and sit down with some other thru hikers. A southbounder was telling a story about how he had hiked all day to get to Pinkham Notch, only to arrive at the visitors center who told him he wasn‚Äôt allowed to camp there. When he asked where he could camp, they said he had to hike a half mile back north, which he didn‚Äôt want to do, so he stealth camped just on the other side of the highway. Someone else was empathetic, but I found myself siding completely with the visitors center and getting frustrated with him. Maybe yesterday‚Äôs conversation bled into my feelings a bit too, but this just feels like thru-hiker entitlement; it doesn‚Äôt really matter how far he hiked that day, or how far he has to climb to reach a camping area, the rules were written before he arrived and he doesn‚Äôt have much of a right to be upset. But as I found myself getting upset, I excused myself and headed back to the trail.</p>\n<p>After getting up Madison and down below treeline, the last 1.5 miles were a pretty steep descent. Java arrived a bit before me, and Waffles and Hawkeye arrived a bit after. I think the day really took it out of them. I could tell they were a little frustrated, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine hiking a trail this long with my parents. So many opportunities to get into huge fights and not much space away from them to help mitigate. My heart goes out to them.</p>\n<p>I figured out why Gorham is on the 18 mile/day itinerary twice: you can get there either via Rt 16 or via Rt 2, and it‚Äôs ~20 miles between the two highways. Tomorrow, I‚Äôm planning to get into Gorham at Rt 16, maybe with Waffles and Hawkeye. We‚Äôll see what tomorrow brings.

Initially I planned to shuttle into Gorham with Java and Stumbles, but when we (me, Beat Box, and the guy who doesn‚Äôt like the AMC) got to the base of the mountain, we met a trail angel/fan of Waffles‚Äô/Hawkeye‚Äôs YouTube channel who had agreed to give them a ride into town. He said he had enough room for the rest of us too, so I scored a free ride!</p>\n<p>While we were waiting for Waffles and Hawkeye to come down the mountain, we grabbed some breakfast at the Pinkham Notch visitors center. This was another spot that I think I‚Äôve been to before. They have some old photos of the AMC huts back when they were new, and some of them pre-date the AT itself. I think this helped give some perspective that the AMC isn‚Äôt just capitalizing on federal land; instead, they took on the task of making these trails and building the huts far before the trail started getting the yearly AT traffic it does today, and they look after the land through a somewhat complex relationship with the government (at least, complex to me). He‚Äôs still not sure how he feels about paying to stay on federal land, but I think he realizes now that it wasn‚Äôt quite as simple as he originally made it out to be.</p>\n<p>Waffles and Hawkeye caught up to us shortly after breakfast, and we caught a ride into Gorham with the trail angel. We stopped to let Beat Box and friends out at the hostel they were staying at, and the trail angel gave us all some homemade blueberry pie to enjoy, topped with locally picked blueberries. He didn‚Äôt have any plates, but my hand did just fine, even if it was a bit sticky.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs a dynamic I don‚Äôt quite understand around trail angels and trail vloggers. Waffles and Hawkeye are documenting their thru, and people like this trail angel are living vicariously through their videos, and in turn become kind of a fan base. The trail angel had brought a kind of sumptuous feast for them, including lobster rolls which can‚Äôt be all that cheap in NH, and thanked them repeatedly for what they do. I think what he means by that is first and foremost the hard work of hiking the AT, but I think what he really means is the work of documenting their hike and making it accessible. I gave up posting even photos of the trail on social media; it felt performative, and took energy away from the direct experience of being on trail and away from society. There‚Äôs a part of this dynamic that feels wrong to me, but it‚Äôs also an act of bartering: trading lobster rolls for an insight into the lived experience of trail life. I couldn‚Äôt ever partake in either side of this, but I think I empathize with it a bit more now.</p>\n<p>The trail angel was very giving of his time, and I walked a thin line around yogiing a trip to Walmart and a ride back to the trailhead. I spent about 3 hours off trail, but if it weren‚Äôt for this trail angel, it would have been the better part of the day, and I‚Äôm extremely grateful.</p>\n<p>The climb out of Pinkham Notch was about as steep as the descent into it, but my legs got up Wildcat just fine. I was kind of hoping to get another Work For Stay at Carter Notch hut, so I powered through and passed some guys at the gondola without stopping for longer than it took to eat a single clif bar. It turned out that some south-bounders snagged WFS before I could (of course), but the croo had a good suggestion on a stealth spot just outside of where the Forest Protection Area ends. I found a good tent spot and had some time to chill before bed, so I checked out ‚Äúthe remnants‚Äù on the advice of one of the other hikers. Apparently, Carter Dome, which is now rounded off, used to have a more angular peak, but the top of the mountain broke off years and years ago, and you can still see the remnants of that as a series of boulders at the base of the mountain.</p>\n<p>After I turned in for the night, I heard Chappy, Hawaii, and Red Maple arrive at the stealth spot. They somehow managed to find spots for 3 tents in an area where there really wasn‚Äôt any great spots to be had. They might not always be quiet when they get into camp late, but I‚Äôll definitely grant them some ingenuity in making the best out of a less than stellar campsite.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Osgood Tentsite","end":1873}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":112,"date":"2024-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Rattle River Shelter","end":1897,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"üòê","sleepScore":null,"garminFeedback":"RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS","trainingReadiness":57},"html":"<p>On one hand, I confirmed this morning that my bathtub is leaking, after last night‚Äôs rain.

None of this switchback crap, I just walked down one mountain and up another in less than 30 minutes. To be honest though, I could deal with a little bit less adrenaline and a few more switchbacks.</p>\n<p>One thing I‚Äôm definitely appreciating though is how Maine tends the trail. I didn‚Äôt really have much of an understanding of different trail maintenance organizations before coming out on the AT. I realized a few things though while being out here: northern PA sucked, Bear Mountain in NY shouldn‚Äôt have replaced a mountain with a set of stairs, and now, the Maine Appalachian Trail Club is finding a balance between kindness and ruggedness. I always thought I appreciated the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ascents and descents of VT and NH, where a hill will have rocks arranged as if they had naturally been deposited there by a glacier thousands of years ago, at just the right distance away from each other. Maine has some places where the rocks are clearly placed by human hands, not by Mother Nature. But they‚Äôre definitely not the same hands that put all those steps on Bear Mountain. I don‚Äôt feel coddled by the trail like I sometimes felt in Connecticut. Instead, it‚Äôs rugged as fuck, but with a heart. Somehow, also, the trail manages to be a story teller of where you‚Äôre going, and the possibilities of where you could go. In Vermont, I could stand on Abraham and look south and see where I came from, and look north and see where I was headed, partly because the Green Mountains hug the ridgeline and there were few options to begin with. In Vermont, it was the mountains that told me where to go, but in Maine, it‚Äôs the trail. Coming down Baldpate, I could see the mountains laid out before me; I knew my future.

I talked to Ted today and ‚Äúsolidified‚Äù a plan for meeting on Katahdin. Trail logistics are hard!

Speedboat was saying it should be more accessible. This feels a bit like the old MacKaye v.

As someone who grew up hiking through NH and never once felt like it was too hard (but rather, I just wasn‚Äôt hardy enough), I would be sad if they changed the trail. It feels almost sacred to me. And NH has probably the highest concentration of day hikers outside of the Smokies, so I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs scaring people away. I wonder sometimes if it isn‚Äôt that we get so used to hiking through the mid-Atlantic, we want the ease to continue all the way through, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it; Speedboat hikes faster than I do, I don‚Äôt imagine he has much trouble with the ascents. And the hiking community, New England included, has a pretty big problem around accessibility, so I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm defending the status quo. I think I‚Äôm just attached to my mountains. Maybe it‚Äôs Stockholm Syndrome. I also wonder if I‚Äôm just being disagreeable because I‚Äôm overtired. But it‚Äôs rubbed me the wrong way each time when people want the trail to conform to them. Correction: it‚Äôs rubbed me the wrong way when it was the trail I grew up on; I was one of those people who wanted other sections of the trail to conform to me.
