Day #1 on the AT! It was enough just getting here — I took the train down the previous night (yes, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A0F9lh8TiSM?si=WNNgeRtjFpZy0PGU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Midnight Train to Georgia</a>), paying a bit more for a fold-out bed but not like it was easy to fall asleep anyway. On the ride down, I was massaging my foot, dealing with some muscle tightness from an impromptu run the day before. Well, however ready my body is or isn’t, I’m here.</p>\n<p>The train pulled in about 30 minutes late into Gainesville GA but <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063487306565\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ron</a> my shuttle driver made it work. On the ride there, Ron quizzed his three passengers on preparedness: did we know about the norovirus outbreak? did we know about long water carries? how much water were we carrying? In almost every fact that Ron talked about, there was at least one kernel I wasn’t already aware of. One of the other passengers had attempted the AT last year, and made it nearly a week before stopping; she knew her knees wouldn’t see her to Katahdin, but she just wanted to get farther this year than she did last year. The other passenger was carrying a portable CPAP machine to manage his sleep apnea. And here I was with a 40L pack, thankful that the electronics portion of my base weight was so much more manageable.</p>\n<p>Ron dropped us off at the Amicalola Falls Visitor Center, where I was just in time to sign in, get my hang tag, weigh my pack, and attend a short slideshow lecture on the Georgia part of the trail. One thing that stuck with me was the advice to only hike around 8 miles each day in the first few days, even if my lungs and muscles were fine with more, due to the time it takes for ligaments/tendons to warm up. It sounded like good advice, and I plan at least to not totally ignore it. I took one last photo of a sheet marked “GEORGIA SHUTTLE DRIVERS”, made sure I had everything, and walked on out, as the next wave of arrivers was getting started with the same slideshow lecture. It was 10am by this time, and I needed to get this party started if I wanted to make some miles and get to camp at a decent hour.</p>\n<p>Just as I was walking out, I saw Haroula, a fellow Bostonian whose sister was apparently starting the trail on the same day as me. Haroula’s whole family had come down to see her sister off. Haroula called out to me as I left the visitor center, and I told her about my eventful train ride down. She told me her sister had started an hour ago, but was planning to camp at the same shelter I was. I was excited to come into the trail already “knowing” someone, even if I only actually knew her sister, and not even that well.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the approach trail was a bunch of stairs. There was some renovation going on, so the normal path up the “Stairs of Death” (a respected rite of passage) was inaccessible; in their stead were an equally grueling set of stairs. But once I got up, there was still a beautiful sight to take in: the tallest waterfall in the state of Georgia.</p>\n<p>The top of Amicalola Falls was approximately 1 mile into my day, but I still had another 7 miles to get to the top of Springer Mountain where the trail actually began, and then another 3 miles to get to my shelter destination of Stover Creek. The hike up was pretty manageable, and the wooded summit still gave a good view on the mountains Somewhere Out There. But now I’m actually on the trail. The one with the white blazes. While chilling out at the summit, I met Brad, from Florida. Brad was also thru hiking, but his parents had come up to Springer to hike with him on his first day. I chatted with them a bit about the excitement, nerves, and expectations, but soon I said goodbye and gave them the mountain to themselves.</p>\n<p>I finished up at Stover Creek Shelter around 3:30pm, leaving me a few hours before sunset to set up my tent and get dinner. I found a cozy piece of ground outside the shelter to make food; norovirus stuck around on surfaces for periods of up to 2 weeks or so, which made the shelters themselves somewhat off limits. While I ate, I chatted with someone who turned out to be Dema, Haroula’s sister. A little while later, Thomas and Kyler came over and hung out, and we all chatted about expectations. Thomas had hiked as far as Virginia a few years back, and that opened up more questions. What were the Smokies like? How were resupplies? But we also all wondered, how big was the thru-hiker turnout this year? How big would the bubble be? As much as I want to let the trail wash over me, I also want to get past the bubble. It seems like a lot of hikers signed up to start in March, and given that no one is staying in the shelters, the tent sites will likely be packed.</p>\n<p>It was pretty cold and windy by the end of the night, down to around 38º, and the next few nights are supposed to be colder. I guess I’ll learn all about what Georgia mountains are like in Spring.</p>"},"previous":null},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":2,"date":"2024-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Gooch Mountain Shelter","end":15.7,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":58,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":2},"html":"<p>It was cold, waking up. As I lay under my quilt, I could already hear the other tents around me, packing up and chatting to each other quietly. Two people accidentally kicked one of my tent stakes — either camp is crowded, or I need to do a better job pounding stakes into the ground, or both.</p>\n<p>I got out of camp kind of late (after 9am?). After about 2.5 miles in, I saw Forklift (who I met in passing yesterday) and her friend Mosey, stopped at a waterfall. I wasn’t going to say no to new opportunities, and I walked the 0.2 miles down a side trail to get a view of the falls. I was impressed that Forklift and Mosey already had trail names on just Day 2 — apparently they had met while hiking the PCT. The falls was nice — two waterfalls in two days! — and I wonder a bit if every day will have a little side quest just like this. Mosey offered to take a picture of me with the falls, but I declined; I didn’t want to make my journey about me, and I didn’t want to stop observing. But Mosey said from experience that one of the biggest mistakes one could make was to not get pictures of themselves along the way, to see how they changed from start to finish. I’ll have to keep that in mind, how I can capture my own change without being a tourist of the trail.</p>\n<p>Damn, does Sassafras Mountain have steep grade. 🥵</p>\n<p>Before I started the trail, I planned to use the AT Guide <a href=\"https://www.theatguide.com/12-milesday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12 mile</a>/<a href=\"https://www.theatguide.com/15-milesday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15 mile</a> plans as a baseline for where I might want to stop for the night, given no other factors. But those plans assume you’re starting from mile 0 at the summit of Springer Mountain, whereas I started some 8 miles before then, so I subtracted a little from the plan in order to make similar miles. About 11 miles from Stover Creek is Devil’s Kitchen, which has spots for 8 tents. But when I got there, it … didn’t look appetizing. It just didn’t feel right. And there were some guys taking a water break at the creek right before it, and they were planning on moving on. So I decided to let momentum take me another mile and a half to Gooch Mountain Shelter.</p>\n<p>Gooch Mountain Shelter seems like it’s well organized out of necessity. As you enter the grounds, there’s a map of where all the campsites are, and signs saying that each dirt tent pad should have two tents. I went off to start setting up on an empty dirt pad, wondering who my neighbor for the night might be, as the campground would certainly fill up. Shortly after I finished setting up, Clark and his daughter Olivia rolled in. Olivia was planning to do a large section of the AT (maybe the whole thing), while her dad was planning on hiking with her for just the first week before returning home. When I told Olivia that I was from Boston, she said that she was planning to move to the area after college, but she wasn’t sure yet exactly what she hoped to find there — with a background in music and english, I told her I’d connect her with my friend who teaches in Mass. There was just enough signal to send a text out. Clark offered me the use of his sit pad when he noticed I didn’t have my own, and I was just about to graciously accept when I took my hand away at the last moment. He must have been confused until I explained to him about the norovirus outbreak, and we weren’t supposed to touch other people’s stuff. I think he was grateful that I told him, as he said he didn’t know — they both seem nice. I really like how the trail kind of comes with its own in-built community, and Clark and Olivia and I can all kind of interact as friends, making connections and offering sit pads and sleeping within 5 feet of each other, without ever seeing each other before today.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":"Amicalola Falls","destination":"Stover Creek Shelter","end":2.8}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":3,"date":"2024-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Bull Gap","end":32.4,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":50,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":1},"html":"<p>I woke up to the sound of Clark and Olivia chatting and making plans. It turns out, Olivia came down with norovirus and started presenting symptoms this morning. I guess symptoms show up around 12 hours after contracting the virus, so I’m really glad now that I didn’t borrow that sit pad from Clark. Their plan of hiking for a week through Georgia has been cut short, and now their new plan is to get off trail as soon as possible. I gave them the photo of all the Georgia shuttle drivers, and told them that my shuttle driver Ron was great, but I guess Ron has a full plate and won’t be able to get them out until this afternoon. I made oatmeal and coffee, partly as a means to boil the water I had in yet another attempt to keep norovirus at bay, and chatted with them while they planned. This morning was an even later start to my hike than yesterday, not leaving camp until around 9:45. More or less everybody had cleared out before me.</p>\n<p>Today’s hike included Blood Mountain, the high point of the Georgia section. Ron had made it sound like a challenge, but it didn’t seem very strenuous. All around the mountain are these little clusters of short trees, I don’t know what they are — I want to call them olive gardens, because that’d be hilarious, even though they’re definitely not olive trees. At the base of the mountain is Neels Gap (or Neel Gap, depending on who you talk to or which sign you read); after the arches and steps and waterfall of Amicalola and the summit of Springer Mountain on Day 1, this was my first AT landmark, home of the iconic <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-appalachian-trail-shoe-tree\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shoe tree</a>. It’s also the first spot along the trail that sells pizza. They sell frozen pizza, but they’ll microwave it <em>for free</em>. What a country. I bought a ton of other snacks including a tuna packet, chocolate milk, some iced tea, a lighter and some hand sanitizer, and I think they conned me into buying an extra fuel canister unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>While I ate my pizza, I chatted with Dema and Forklift. Looking at FarOut, the ubiquitous trail smartphone app, the next shelter was Vogel State Park, though they charged $25 for tent sites, which didn’t sound great. But Dema and Forklift said that just a mile up the trail was Bull Gap, a tent-only campsite that had room for plenty of tents. This sounded great, as I hadn’t even considered staying outside of the grounds of a shelter.</p>\n<p>I got to Bull Gap and set up my tent, but I don’t think I did a great job. This is my first trekking pole tent, and while it looks easy on YouTube, it’s definitely not easy for me. Even when I feel like I’m doing it somewhat efficiently, it still takes probably twice as long as those practiced YouTubers. And the tent I have (a Durston XMid Pro) is a pretty popular tent — I wonder if I’ll see anyone else with it and be able to grab some pointers. After setting up for the night, I had my first opportunity to cross another milestone off my list: I dug my first cat hole. I’ve now officially pooped in the woods.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Gooch Mountain Shelter","end":15.7}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":4,"date":"2024-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Low Gap Shelter","end":43,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":40,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":1},"html":"<p>Last night was super windy.

Technically, I was offered trail magic on my first day, but it felt weird being offered a candy bar on my first day out, so I declined. Today however, I rolled up to Hogpen Gap, and there after the road crossing was a super nice dude with a pop-up canopy, a wide selection of snacks, a charging station for electronics, a good number of chairs, a hand washing station, and—the grand finale—homemade veggie stew. This was not this dude’s first rodeo. I took some stew (he did all the serving, following proper norovirus protocols), as well as a kiwi, a brownie, and a mini-cinnamon bun. And then I pushed on.</p>\n<p>At camp tonight at Low Gap Shelter, I met Sink, as well as Tom, a stout 50+ guy from Connecticut.

I made a game time decision to stretch for Dick’s Creek Gap tomorrow, and told Sink to tell Tom that I’d try to meet him there.</p>\n<p>So far, I’ve been able to hike virtually all day without sweating, as the southern latitude of Georgia pairs nicely with the early April weather, but I can feel it starting to heat up and I don’t know if I’m going to like it! Unicoi Gap had more trail magic (I’m getting spoiled and I won’t complain); I got myself a hotdog and some chocolate milk. The woman running the stand said that Dema and Forklift passed through just a few hours before. She also has a penchant for giving out some epic trail names: earlier today, when one hiker was excited about a particularly large burl protruding from a tree, she dubbed him <em>Fat Bottomed Burl</em>.

I just lay there and contemplate, or procrastinate, or both.</p>\n<p>Today marked another milestone: my first resupply! I heard conflicting reports from Bullfrog about when the shuttle from Dick’s Creek leaves for Hiawassee, so I aimed for the most aggressive time frame (1pm) and beat it slightly only to wait an hour for the shuttle. A little while after I arrived, a white minivan pulled in, and a woman reported quietly that she was offering trail magic. In her trunk, she had just about everything you could ask for. I scored a banana, an orange, and some gatorade, though I could have gone back for more. A little while later, the shuttle pulled up. The shuttle had a hiker box in the back, and the driver (who had retired a few years back and was now driving this shuttle a few days a week just to be a good guy) offered up anything and everything inside of it. I scored a zip-lock baggie of freeze-dried strawberries, partly because I think I can use the baggie.</p>\n<p>He dropped us off at Ingles, a grocery chain, in Hiawassee. I quietly discovered that Ingles is pronounced like Shingles, not like In-Glace as if it were Spanish. Outside of the supermarket, on the town square, there indeed was a hiker feed, put on by the mayor! Score one for the AT Guide. The potato salad was delicious.</p>\n<p>Ingles had everything I needed, and while I sat at the in-store Starbucks repacking my bear canister, another hiker stopped and chatted with me a bit. She asked me if I had seen the eclipse today, but I figured it wouldn’t be an attraction this far away from its path. Apparently, she said, it was still somewhat visible, and she gave me her pair of eclipse sunglasses, my best trail magic yet. Sure enough, I could still see a little bit of the moon covering the sun.</p>\n<p>While I hung out in Ingles, charging my powerbank, I was able to catch up with Elizabeth, a friend from my Monday night get-togethers!

Another few milestones. As I was figuring out the best way to pack up my wet tent (solution: the same as normal, except wetter), I found a tent stake in the mud left over at the tent closest to mine. Some guys waiting out the rain by the shelter said she left just a little bit before me, so I did the best I could to catch up — but I didn’t get a tenth of the mile up the trail before realizing I had left my inReach satellite device back at the tent site. I definitely can’t be losing things like that, not this early! I ended up catching up to the tent stake’s proper owner about 4 miles in, just before we got to the Georgia/North Carolina state border. We both spent a few minutes desperately trying to unlock our phones to in order to take a photo, but it was so wet that the touch screen wasn’t registering my finger very well. Finally, I got mine open, and we both took a photo with the sign. I’ll have to send her photo when I get into town. Right after the border was this really cool tree that I’ve seen pictures of in other peoples’ journals, but I didn’t realize that it was in this part of the trail! Even though it was wet, it was exciting to cross into North Carolina, and none of the mud here is anything like what I saw in Vermont last year.</p>\n<p>I met Austin, and we were both thinking of heading to Standing Indian Shelter tonight. I got there a little bit before him, and started chatting to the two guys in the shelter, telling them that I was planning to tent (my tent was already wet), but Austin was planning to stay in the shelter with them. One of the guys started saying that Austin better not keep his food in the shelter, because he’s not going to be a party to some bear coming in and ruining the place. He went on for a little while about other people not appreciating bear safety, without any prompt from me. The guy just seemed irritated about just about everything. Somehow he found his way to complaining about how the White Mountains were not nearly as grandiose as everyone made them out to be. His friend, on the other hand, was a gentle soul, but also in rough shape — he was upset with his pants, but felt compelled to wear them because his wife had gifted them to him and he didn’t want to let her down. When Austin arrived a little while later, the first guy was still getting upset about everything, and Austin looked at me so as to say, “are you getting a weird vibe from him too?” And I gave him back a look that said, yep, I’m getting the same vibe. I’m definitely tenting tonight, there’s too much weird energy going on with these two.</p>\n<p>All of the shelters I stayed at in Georgia had bear boxes. Standing Indian has a strongly worded letter, stapled to a tree. “BEAR ALERT”. I’m pretty sure I’ll be fine given I have a bear canister, but the FarOut comments say there’s a problem bear in the area, and he can even crack a PCT bear hang.

But when I woke up, everybody’s bear bag was unharmed. Well, there was one casualty, but it was from a mini-bear: I accidentally left the baggy of freeze-dried strawberries in the shoulder strap pocket of my pack (outside my tent, in the vestibule), and a mouse chewed through it and ate all the strawberries. I wasn’t too concerned about the strawberries, but I’m not crazy about the hole in the shoulder strap pocket. Oh well, I guess it needed to get “broken in”.</p>\n<p>It was nice and cool and misty. I made really good miles today: I went over 3 mountains of ~5000 or taller, and passed maybe 3 or 4 people along the way. And today, I crossed the 100 mile mark! There was a little “100” etched into the blaze of a tree to mark the occasion. I’m pushing ahead of the 15 mile/day plan as I heard there might be a thunderstorm coming and I didn’t want to be on top of Albert Mountain (which has a very metal fire tower) in the middle of it. Luckily I made it to the shelter before the weather turned too badly. Given the impending weather though, I think tonight will be a stay-in-the-shelter night. Winds tonight are supposed to be super rough.</p>\n<p>I was nervous that everybody else would have the same plan, and that it would be a tight squeeze at the shelter tonight (another reason to make good time so that I could get to the shelter early), but when I got there I realized I had nothing to worry about. This shelter is <em>huge</em>, with an upstairs loft. And everybody staying at the shelter is so cool. I introduced myself to one guy, and he looks at me straight-faced and says, “I’m dying.” His trail name was “Dying”. And his comedic delivery was perfect. I also played chess against Gambit (so named because he’s carrying a portable magnetic chess set) — it was a really close game, and I had a potentially winning position as black, but I was content to finish with a draw. When each hiker would walk up to the shelter out of the weather, we’d give them a cheer, and I did the same when Austin rolled in.

Franklin has a shuttle system just like Hiawassee, and picks up at both Rock Gap and Winding Stair Gap, which is 3 or 4 miles further down the trail. Winding Stair would be the ideal spot given that it would put us back on trail with fewer miles to walk, but we weren’t sure if we could make it there before the 9:30am shuttle, so sure enough I found some of my shelter mates huddled under a tree at Rock Gap. I came up singing “Singing in the Rain”, just enjoying the weather. As the shuttle pulled up, we waited for people to get off first before we got on; I guess the stairs were super slippery, as someone almost completely wiped out. In Franklin, I snagged some more food from Ingles (this one a slightly smaller and more limited than the Hiawassee location, but they did have Southern Butter Pecan flavored Talenti), and then treated myself to some large frappuccino-like monstrosity at Brooklyn Bagels. While I was inside, the sky opened up and it rained hard, but then stopped again just when it was time to leave. I don’t think I understand southern weather patterns just yet. I brought my sandwich and frappe back to the gazebo and found a place to charge my phone, having an early lunch with some of other hikers I met on the sidewalk today.</p>\n<p>My original plan was to enjoy town, maybe hang out with some of the peeps from the shelter last night, but after a few hours passed and I had already accomplished my town chores (food to pack out, food to wolf down), I decided to jump on the 12pm shuttle back to Rock Gap. Kind of a bummer, because around an hour later, I finally got a text from Dying about meeting up at 5:30pm.</p>\n<p>As I was getting off the shuttle, I saw that guy from Standing Indian who had made such a fuss about bear safety. (Austin told me later that, while he spent a good 40 minutes looking for a good branch to hang his food, Fussbucket—not a real trail name—hung his from the weakest branch just a few feet off the ground.) I was so fixed on making eye contact with him that I missed my footing and slipped down the shuttle stairs in the same way that this morning’s hikers had. “Careful,” said Fussbucket in a manner that in no way communicated any concern for my safety, and I picked myself up and walked past him, back to the trail. Not 5 minutes later, after the shuttle departed with Fussbucket on his way into town, his friend (the kind one of the two) showed up, out of breath, wondering if I had seen his friend. I had to inform him that he had just left a few minutes before — turns out that this guy busted his butt to make the shuttle, and Fussbucket couldn’t be bothered to wait 5 minutes. And technically, this guy was on time, as the shuttle left some 3 minutes early. Poor guy.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Austin. This morning was maybe the last time I’ll see him, and I didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye. He’s an ex-Marine whose wife died of breast cancer just a short while before he came out on the trail- it was kind of the forcing factor for him to come out here at all. He had already booked an Alaskan cruise some time later this summer with his dad, so I’m not sure if I’ll see him again. He continued on this morning to meet his dad at Winding Stair Gap, and now he could be anywhere.</p>\n<p>The weather continued to hedge between being rainy and stormy, until finally it decided to really storm. The wind was whipping at my shell, and I just focused on keeping my head down and moving forward. Whereas last night’s shelter was large and sturdy, tonight’s shelter was packed like sardines. Storm volunteered for everyone to make space for me, but I could tell I wasn’t going to fit and so I waited for a break in the rain to set up my tent. And now I’m writing this while it’s thundering and lightning-ing; I thought this spot might be well protected from the wind, but my little tent is still getting hammered. This is definitely the first “Type 2 fun” day. Sometimes I can’t believe I’m actually out here on the trail — I’m maybe a bit worried that it won’t sink in until I’m done. I write this with only a thin layer of dyneema protecting me from a thunderstorm. There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle.</p>\n<p>I noticed today that the trail in these parts is cut into the side of the incline. This is maybe an act of kindness,\nso you don’t have to go over the top of the hill directly, but it feels unnatural- I remember “On Trails” which\ntalks about the evolution of trails where iterations find easier, more straightforward paths. This on the other\nhand feels very intentional, which it is. Is intentional the same thing as unnatural? Maybe not, but it feels more\nakin to the product of western thinking than to my ancient forefathers.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Long Branch Shelter","end":102.4}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":10,"date":"2024-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Wesser Bald Shelter","end":131.2,"sleep":"Shelter","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":54,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":8},"html":"<p>Yesterday, I thought I might never see Austin again.

The blue blaze out of shelter was rock and mud and a bit annoying to navigate, but once the path crossed the AT and headed straight up to Siler Bald, it got a bit easier, if you don’t mind steep. I saw two guys take their packs off to lighten their load as they walked up the hill, but I made a point (for no good reason at all) of trying to catch up to them while wearing mine. I did not expect one of the guys to be Austin. Austin introduced me to Siesta, who he had met hiking out of Winding Stair Gap yesterday.</p>\n<p>Side note: Siler Bald Shelter is connected to the AT via the Siler Bald Trail, looping in both directions. Don’t tell anyone, but instead of walking south on the Siler Bald Trail to reconnect to where I had left the AT, I walked north instead, and in doing so, missed about a half mile of the AT. Please don’t tell anyone.</p>\n<p>The top of Wayah Bald seemed like a good lunch spot for Austin, Siesta, and me. It has a cool observation tower, you can see for miles. As we sat there on the north side of the tower to escape the wind, it started snowing — actually, it was sleet! And it was still super windy, so it was blowing everywhere, truly wild. Really fun to hike through, especially as it didn’t accumulate.</p>\n<p>My original plan today was to stop at Cold Spring Shelter, but when I got there, I just didn’t like the vibe. As I refilled my water, Siesta caught up to me, and we chatted about where to end up. He was planning on pushing on to Wesser Bald Shelter, another 6 miles up trail, to put us in a good place to get to the NOC tomorrow and then the Smokies. That’d be a long day, but I felt that I could do it. And we did do it! Siesta’s fast, though. I feel like I’ve been able to offset my late morning starts by walking around 2.7 miles and hour, sometimes a bit more, but I’m barely keeping up with Siesta. It turns out he’s a true ultralight hiker: he doesn’t carry a power bank, he’s cold soaking his food, and he sleeps on a thin foam pad. Bad ass.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Siler Bald Shelter","end":113.3}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":11,"date":"2024-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Sassafras Gap Shelter","end":144,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":49,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_RECHARGE","trainingReadiness":17},"html":"<p>I got a little turned around this morning and couldn’t remember which way was north. I walked about a tenth of a mile in one direction before I ran into Chris, who I had met at the mayor’s hiker feed back in Hiawassee. My doubt about which direction I was going in made him doubt which direction he was going in! He was right and I was wrong, so I’m glad I found out then before getting too far.</p>\n<p>This morning’s hike was really cool. Right after the shelter, the trail is on the ridgeline, but still mostly in the trees. And then, a switchback brings you out of the trees and gives you a view of the entire valley. It was an amazing view, up there with Franconia Ridge, and I’m bummed I didn’t get a picture (there was someone behind me).</p>\n<p>At the base of Wesser Bald is another milestone, the Nantahala Outdoor Center or NOC. As soon as I get there, I see Hitman, who I met the other day at the same shelter as Storm. I told him I came from Wesser Bald Shelter, and he says, “Oh, the norovirus shelter?” Apparently someone had thrown up in the shelter a few days before, and that makes the four of us who stayed there exposed. Great.</p>\n<p>The NOC seems mostly like a tourist spot for white water rafters and the like, but I was able to eat a full breakfast, get some laundry done, print out my Smokies permit, and charge my electronics. Austin showed up, and we hung out a bit — he was meeting someone to buy a tent replacement for the tarp system he was using. We grabbed a late lunch, but then it was time for me to move on, as the next shelter was 7 miles away, all up hill. I’ve been going faster than Austin the last few days and I get the sense that he wants me to slow down a bit and stay at a similar pace, but he’ll be off trail soon and I feel like I want to cover more ground. Technically there are some hotels or motels around here, but they cater to white water rafting tourists who are here to spend money, and that’s not what I’m looking for.</p>\n<p>While I was charging my electronics, I checked my email and saw that I had a letter from the Green Mountain Club — they were looking for potential panelists to help give a zoom info session about their experiences on the Long Trail. I had seen an email in March about it and even started filling out an application, but stopped when I tried answering the question of what I would bring to the panel; <em>“Dear GMC, I would bring to the table the unique perspective of a white dude from Massachusetts. Please include me in your panel!”</em> But today, the GMC reached out to me specifically, noting that I had indicated after finishing the trail that I’d be excited about sharing my experiences, and asked if I’d be interested in discussing it. I let them know that, yes I’m interested, but given that I’m out here on the AT, that could either be a really interesting perspective or a really gnarly scheduling exercise. I guess we’ll see what happens.</p>\n<p>I said a final goodbye as Austin’s tent connection showed up. It was getting on 3:30pm at this point, and I was doing some quick calculations. Sunset’s at 8pm, but tent spots fill up before then, and I’d have to beat 2 miles per hour just to make it before 7pm so that I wasn’t eating dinner in the dark. Normally I’ve been getting 2.7 or 2.8 miles per hour but not uphill. I finished right around 6pm, so I think that put me around 2.7 miles per hour, going up hill! And I saw my first snake on trail: it was a black snake, and I think we both gave each other a good scare. As I pulled into the shelter, I saw there weren’t many great tenting options, at least not this late, and I found a spot on the side of the hill that would do in a pinch.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Wesser Bald Shelter","end":131.2}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":12,"date":"2024-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Cable Gap Shelter","end":159.4,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":55,"garminFeedback":"FIND_TIME_TO_RELAX","trainingReadiness":29},"html":"<p>Today started off really hard.

And I got a trail name!!!</p>\n<p>About an hour into the trail, I saw a big body of water barely visible through the trees, and as I descended the hill, it became clearer: this was Fontana Lake. Along the way, I saw purple flowers (an iris?) poking out of the ground — Spring was doing its thing! Most of Georgia was some form of monochromatic brown, and while the cooler temperatures have been great to hike through, I’m looking forward to a bit more color. I got to Fontana Dam Road just after 11am, where there was a tiny building with a set of bathroom stalls and a power outlet. I charged my electronics while I waited for a shuttle to bring me into Fontana Village, where I’d get my first mail drop.</p>\n<p>Before I started the trail, I did a google search for “trail towns with the worst resupply”, and Fontana Village came up high in the results. As the only resupply spot around before the Smokies, prices can get pretty high, and we’re out of Ingles territory now. Having read about this ahead of time, I coordinated with family back home to send dehydrated meals, clif bars, and a Talenti jar (this was before I snagged some from Franklin) to the Fontana Village post office. The pickup process at the post office was smooth, and when I saw the prices in the general store, I was really happy with my decision to send food by mail! I bought the dehydrated food in bulk during a Black Friday sale, paying around $9/serving, and most of the meals in the general store were around $20. Even though it cost almost $20 to ship food from Boston, it was well worth it.</p>\n<p>After I repacked my bag, I walked down to the Pit Stop, a gas station that also serves chili dogs, and grabbed some food. The guy who drove our shuttle (trail name of ‘Shua, or Joshua) came in, grabbed a hot dog, and sat next to me, and we got talking. Toward the end, he asked me my name, and I gave my stock answer of “I don’t have a trail name yet” *hint hint*, and this time, he suggested <em>Marathon</em>. Marathon? I asked—had I told him that I ran Boston during the pandemic year? I couldn’t remember—and he replied about it being such an iconic piece of Boston. It was perfect, not because I had run Boston 4 years ago, but because I needed to remind myself that this was a marathon and not a sprint, because I had been pushing myself hard these past few days but I needed to remember to enjoy it, and not push my body to points of exhaustion like I felt I had done at times on the Long Trail.</p>\n<p>One thing ‘Shua said that stuck with me (and I don’t remember the context, but it still stands alone):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re all in the same boat, but there’s a leak in one end, and we’re just content to move over to the end that’s sticking further up.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dam(n), it’s good to be out here.</p>\n<p>A short while later, ‘Shua drove me and the others back to Fontana Dam Road, and I hiked the 1.5 miles to my destination for the night, Fontana Dam Shelter. What a spot! Also known as the “Fontana Hilton”, it had showers and an industrial-sized solar charging station. Pretty gorgeous views of the lake. And there was a good crew: Hitman, and Thomas and Kyler, and Terminator, and a whole bunch of people I hadn’t met before but seemed awesome. Strider, who had started months before me and almost sheltered at my house in Boston before finding better accommodations, had arrived here as well, and he had great news: I hadn’t been exposed to norovirus after all! Apparently, he was the author of the comment in FarOut about someone throwing up in the shelter at Wesser Bald, but he found out later that it was due to food poisoning. I was healthy after all! The Icelandic couple I had met in Franklin showed up, and apparently the guy had enjoyed a Wendy’s experience so much, he acquired a trail name of Baconator. I met Live Mas, who was from the area and knew so much about the Smokies (and why we had to pay $40 to walk through it). Today was my first shower on the trail, and I needed it. I walked only 6 or 7 miles today, but today was a good day. We’ll see what the Smokies brings.</p>\n<p>I also had a chance to connect with Lorne from the Green Mountain Club about being a panelist for the Long Trail information session. He asked me a few questions, like when I hiked, and whether I had gone to college; I told him that one of the things I liked best about the Long Trail was how narrow the mountain range was, and how this made it very easy to see just where you were coming from (the easily visible mountain just south) and where you were going (the easily visible mountain just north). The mountains weren’t just points on a map, but your past and your future. This was just maybe a better answer than “I enjoyed a mud hellscape, mostly without views. A++ type two fun, would maybe never do again.” I told him I was excited to be on the panel, and while I was a bit concerned about logistics of finding internet along the trail, I was willing to try to make it work. He seemed game, so now I’m going to be talking to potential End-to-Enders in the beginning of May.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Cable Gap Shelter","end":159.4}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":14,"date":"2024-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Russell Field Shelter","end":181.1,"sleep":"Shelter","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":84,"garminFeedback":"TAKE_ON_THE_DAY","trainingReadiness":58},"html":"<p>This morning’s walk was a pretty big departure from the last few weeks. Instead of walking in the mountains at around 4000 or 5000 feet above sea level, I walked over the dam today at around 1700 feet above sea level. Immediately following the dam, there were National Park Service signs for “Great Smoky Mountains National Park”, and shortly after that, the box to deposit the entry portion of my Smokies permit. The way the permit system works is, you print out your permit ahead of time, rip it in half, stick half of it in a box upon entering, and stick the other half in a box upon exiting. I’m not sure how often they collect the permits, but this morning the entry box was full.</p>\n<p>I’m not really sure what to expect from hiking through a National Park — I kind of feel like it should be an even more pristine form of nature than I’ve been hiking through so far.</p>\n<p>Today was my first chance to go up a fire tower on a clear day, and I took it. Two years ago, on an overnight hike in Vermont, I walked right by a fire tower on top of Stratton Mountain, and when I went up Stratton again while on the Long Trail this past year, it was socked in with no chance of views. It left an imprint that opportunities are finite and fleeting and unpredictable, and I resolved to climb every fire tower I could if it were a clear day. Shuckstack gave me my first choice, and while it didn’t disappoint, it was maybe a bit… too much. A few days ago, coming down into the NOC, the view unfolded and revealed itself like a story, but the view from Shuckstack was a bit like that at the Grand Canyon, where you’re presented with all of it all at once, with no build-up or release of dramatic tension. I’m not disappointed! just a bit overwhelmed. There’s just so much.</p>\n<p>I saw Hitman having lunch at Mollies Ridge and stopped to grab a snack, but kept moving after a few minutes when I got sick of the flies surrounding the campfire pit. Just a few steps later, I saw my first deer! And, I saw a really colorful millipede this morning. Maybe hiking through a national park <em>will</em> show me an even more pristine form of nature than I’ve seen so far.</p>\n<p>I got to Russell Field, my home for the night, and it was covered by a tarp. The same was true with Mollies Ridge shelter, I’m not sure what the deal is. To protect against bears? To protect from high winds at high elevation? Unknown. Some familiar faces were there, including Thomas (now known as Brightside?) and Kyler. Dema walked by, exclaiming “Hi Liam!”, and I shouted back, “It’s Marathon now!” I no longer answer to <em>“Liam”</em>. Forklift and Mosey were there too, and Forklift let me take some pictures of her tree identification book. Each page had a picture of leaf patterns, a picture of bark patterns, and paragraphs about identification and habitat. It’s been an objective of mine to learn how to identify trees while I’m out here, and now I’d be armed with real knowledge.

Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT, is tomorrow. They’re planning to get to Double Spring Gap Shelter tonight; the 15 mile plan I’ve been loosely following has me staying at Siler’s Bald Shelter, but Double Spring Gap is just 1.7 more miles, which feels really doable. Besides, I already stayed at Siler Bald Shelter, staying at <em>Siler’s Bald</em> as well would just be confusing.</p>\n<p>A guy with a trail name of Tarzan came to our shelter tonight and started making steaks in the fire ring. I’m not sure if the wind picked up or if it got dark or what, but he moved it into the fireplace. The shelter has a stone fireplace built into the shelter itself, but I’m not sure how smart it is to be broadcasting the smell of meat to any bears in the neighborhood. I’m pretty sure this isn’t supposed to be a thing? I think Kyler recorded it on video. Nobody knew how long the meat had been sitting in his pack either. He also had chicken, that he was keeping cool by storing it in the water supply (in plastic packaging)? He said he was hiking the IAT (International AT), which I think extends to Florida and Newfoundland (at least, on this continent) — he credits a high meat and fish oil diet. I guess diet is highly personal, which is fine, but when he started burning the trash (“I know it’s bad but it’s better than leaving it for the bears”) and leaving leftover tinfoil in the stove for others to clean up, I was frustrated. I take my own personal approach to <a href=\"https://lnt.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LNT</a> somewhat seriously, but I never know how to deal with others. “Hike Your Own Hike”, of course, but is there a line? Last week at Siler Bald, Storm left a cantaloupe on the table, and I asked her if she could take care of it, she said she had finished with it, and it wasn’t her responsibility anymore. When I left the next morning, it was in the middle of the trail.

This is a little bit of a bummer, as I already have a mail drop on its way to Standing Bear, but I can still pay $5 to pick it up without staying, and they never got back to me when I texted them the other day about renting a bunk. I thought Standing Bear was another iconic spot along the trail, and the sense I get from Mosey is that it is, but just not the vibe that I’d really be into.</p>\n<p>We were all talking about going to Clingmans Dome tomorrow, and the weather is supposed to be pretty meh — I think I offered up the idea of a sunrise hike as a terrible idea joke, but everybody ran with it, and now we’re all getting up super early tomorrow so we can hike in the dark so we can get to Clingmans Dome before sunrise.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Russell Field Shelter","end":181.1}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":16,"date":"2024-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Peck's Corner Shelter","end":218.5,"sleep":"Shelter","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":50,"garminFeedback":"LISTEN_TO_YOUR_BODY","trainingReadiness":34},"html":"<p>We did it — we woke up far too early to hike 3 miles to the tallest point on the AT. And it wasn’t even that hard. The top of Clingmans Dome has a concrete observation tower, and we were there bright and early (with only a small crowd of people who were there before us, the Smokies are the most popular park in the country and this might be its most popular destination) to see the sun diffuse through heavy clouds. I heard later that the clouds melted off by 9am or so, and if we had just gotten up at a normal hour, we would have had a better view (not to mention a better sleep), but doing things reasonably is for suckers. If I wanted to do things reasonably, would I really be out here in the first place?</p>\n<p>The observation tower in the books, we walked down the road toward the visitor center as everyone else is planning on doing some road miles. I misheard Brightside as having said there was a vending machine, and soon everyone in the group was full-on expecting it to exist. When we reached the visitor center and it wasn’t even open yet, I was only partly devastated. We had breakfast on the stone wall behind the parking lot bathrooms, and it was time to part ways, though I wasn’t nervous as I was pretty sure I’d see at least a few people later on today or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>The rest of the morning was kind of beautiful, as I walked out of one forest and into another: somewhat dramatically, I stopped seeing trees of one type and started seeing trees of another. I really do need to get better at identifying trees, though I want to say I walked into a variety of pines. There was just enough mist and fog floating through the trees to give it an air of magic. There was also a literal fence enclosure, or exclosure: apparently, wild hogs had been decimating the beech population, so they created a fence to keep the hogs out, and it’s wild to see so many beech trees growing in such a small, specific slice of land.</p>\n<p>When I got to Newfound Gap, I saw Hitman in a group trying to get a hitch to Gatlinburg — he was tired and wanted a break, but I selfishly was hoping just a bit not to lose people just yet. It was my own choice too, as they asked me if I wanted to come along, but I wanted to keep the inertia going. After they scored a ride a minute or two later, I sat down to trail magic and rested up just a bit.</p>\n<p>Walking out of Newfound Gap, I spotted my first sign for Katahdin! I also spotted a noticeable difference in walking speed between me and the day hikers. Of course the one woman who was closest to keeping up with my speed was a retiree from Colorado, the state where outdoorsy people go to live outdoors.</p>\n<p>Later on, I caught up with Chris, and I was relieved; I thought everyone I knew had left, and I was alone again on the AT. We met a friend of Tarzan’s chilling out at Icewater Shelter, who made an empathetic case for him. There’s always another side to someone, and one of Tarzan’s other sides is that he likes carrying things as ballast, including dog food. I don’t remember Tarzan’s friend’s name, but I do remember that her dog’s name was Cujo, and that Cujo scared away 3 bears at Russell Field shelter a few nights back.</p>\n<p>Chris and I carried on. We checked out Charlies Bunion and took pictures, but soon I started to outpace him; there’s this constant battle in me between wanting to be social and make friends on trail, and wanting to burn miles, and I feel best about my body on trail when I’m pushing it forward. Today was my first day getting to 20 miles, and my legs and lungs were happy about it, though my feet were pretty tired. I got to Peck’s Corner ahead of Chris, and again I was a stranger to everyone in the shelter. Someone in the shelter had an equipment emergency, their hipbelt having attempted to run away from their pack, and I was able to lend them my sowing kit. I don’t even know how to use it myself (I’m convinced I could figure out if I had to), but I’m glad to see it’s going to good use.

And again, I was the last one out of camp this morning. Not like I had far to go — it was almost exactly 3 miles downhill from Deer Park Shelter to Hot Springs NC, and I took more or less the whole thing at a trot, trending toward canter. I’ve discovered that different knees prefer different trail directions; one of my knees has a harder time with going uphill while the other one has a harder time going down. But I’ve discovered that, if I land with my forefoot, going downhill gets a bit easier. So I’ve adopted this gait sometimes where one foot lands on the forefoot while the other lands on the heel. Human bodies are weird, human bodies walking all day every day are weirder. Whatever works, works.</p>\n<p>I had booked my own personal room at the hostel, and checked in around 9:30am. After I put my stuff down, I looked on the map for the nearest coffee shop. But not just any shop that sells coffee. During one town stop on the Long Trail, I bought myself an affogato, and it was <em>delicious</em>. The milkfat is also probably important too. So now when I’m in town, I search for the coffee shop that’s most likely to have an espresso machine, and hopefully some ice cream to go with it.</p>\n<p>Hot Springs is a really lovely little trail town, with a main drag that runs for just a few blocks. Laughing Heart was at one end, and so I started out toward coffee, which I never drink while on the trail (it takes too much time and wastes a boil) but is a trail town staple for me. After walking just a block or so (the trail itself goes right down the main street!), I saw Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and Honeybuns walking toward me; they also had gotten their rooms settled, and were headed to the diner for breakfast. I planned to hit up the diner after, but I couldn’t pass up breakfast company, so I asked if I could join them, and we headed over to the Smoky Mountain Diner. After we had finished our breakfast but were still chatting, some friends of Fire Magic’s named Lost and Liberty came in and sat down with us. Lost was a tall and lanky Virginian, while Liberty resembled the me I’d aspire to in 10 years, albeit with a Scottish accent.</p>\n<p>After breakfast was chore time. But first, fancy coffee. I walked the 0.3 miles to Artisun, and DID YOU KNOW THEY HAD A PIANO?! Holy crap. After accidentally finding a piano inside the Inn at the Long Trail, I had googled a few times about which hostels along the AT might have a piano, but came up dry. And here I was at a random coffee shop in North Carolina, and they had a piano. After getting my coffee, I asked the barista if I could borrow their piano, and they were happy to lend it. I spent a good chunk of time either playing old songs or just capturing the mood.</p>\n<p>After a little while it was time to get some real chores done. I noticed this morning that my water bottle and filter was missing in action, so I looked into the Outfitter to see if they might carry the same one, but they didn’t have the bottle in the same size, so I bought a pair of trail gaiters instead. (I’ll always miss my Dirty Girl gaiters, and I’ll never forgive Topo for making a proprietary gaiter system. But here I am, giving it a shot.) I grabbed some mediocre food options from a picked-over Dollar General, and headed back to Laughing Heart to get some laundry done. Their loaner clothes were infinitely more interesting than the oversized tees of the Inn at the Long Trail, and I pared a camoflage henley with a pair of purple capri pants that fit perfectly; “the bottoms for when I want to be seen, and the top for when I don’t.”</p>\n<p>Going back to search for my water filter would add 6 miles to my day, which was a bummer, but I’d have to do it. But while I was chatting with someone at the hostel about having lost it, the hostel’s caretaker overheard me and asked what kind it was — apparently, Numbers had seen my bottle along the trail and rescued it. The chances of someone else spotting it, deciding to pick it up, deciding to carry it north, and deciding to bring it to this hostel out of all places, must be pretty slim, but the trail does provide.</p>\n<p>With time now left on the day, I headed back to Artisun to purchase a sugary excuse to sit down at the piano again. Honeybuns came in and saw me, and (unbeknownst to me in the moment) grabbed a video of me playing. Later that day, Honeybuns told me that there was a chapel at Laughing Heart that had a piano, so (almost immediately) I went to check it out. I noodled on one of the progressions I was playing with at Artisun, and a lyric came to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is who we are <br>\nIn the fields, in the bars <br>\nIn the streets, in the cars <br>\nIn the roots, in the fire <br>\nAnd all that we need in the world is to see our reflection</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the Long Trail, I had an idea to create a musical project, “wind river highway”, inspired by time on the trail, but nothing came of it. I think my problem was that the Long Trail was only 273 miles, and inspiration apparently doesn’t come until mile 274.9.</p>\n<p>I stayed up a bit late tonight, using the hostel wifi to join my normal Monday night hang out with friends “back home”, and by back home I mean Georgia, DC, PA, NY… we usually chat from around 7pm to 8pm and then watch a movie together, and now even 8pm feels late for me. On one hand it was good to update them on how the trail has been, on the other it was nice just to fade into the background and be part of a conversation among old friends, even if I did have a harder time relating to the details of city life than I would have just a month ago or so.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Deer Park Mountain Shelter","end":272}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":21,"date":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Spring Mountain Shelter","end":286.2,"sleep":"Tent","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":32,"garminFeedback":"FIND_TIME_TO_RELAX","trainingReadiness":30},"html":"<p>Of course I stopped by Artisun for a departing coffee/piano visit. Chris walked up as I was enjoying my drink, and we hung out a bit before I moved on — it turns out that Chris is a climber. He said he was meeting up with friends when he got to New Hampshire, so I told him to go visit Rumney. I wonder though, at least for myself, whether I’d have any arm strength by the time I get there. Town stops like this are great for calories, but I can feel my body redistributing itself as I spend more calories than I carry. I weighed myself at the hostel this morning: 146 pounds. I don’t remember exactly how much I weighed before I left, but I’m going to guess I’ve lost maybe 5 pounds so far.</p>\n<p>I crushed the ascent out of Hot Springs today! Along the sidewalk of Hot Springs itself are diamond-shaped AT markers embedded into the concrete sidewalk, but almost immediately after Artisun, over the bridge, the trail takes a hard right and hugs the river for a bit. And after a nice scenic river view, it goes <em>up</em>, and with a full stomach, I attacked it. After a few hours I caught up to Snail Mail and Fire Magic and we hiked together a bit, taking a little detour to check out a fire tower. Two for two on fire tower opportunities! This one was great, too — no rickety steps, and the top was enclosed and protected from the wind. We stayed up there for maybe an hour, looking out and chatting. A local Tennesseean came up for the view, and we chatted with him a bit. One thing I remember him saying, he mentioned seeing some hikers speeding down the trail, somewhat oblivious of their surroundings, and he couldn’t understand why someone wouldn’t slow down just a bit and enjoy the outdoors. I’ve been trying to strike a balance with nature the whole time I’ve been out here, and I told him that once you’ve been out here for a few months, the trees start to blend into each other. Sometimes the thing that’s beautiful is not this particular tree in all its glory, but the comparison of these trees to those completely different trees you saw last week, some 100 miles back. He nodded as if to empathize, but I can tell he bears a strong preference for being able to appreciate the trees in front of him. Personally I wonder a bit if a thru hiker is cursed to lose the ability to enjoy the thing they came out here for, but so far I still feel like I’m net positive.</p>\n<p>We got to the shelter by around 5pm. A few days ago, I covered 3 or 4 shelters in a day, and today, I took 2 days to get from one shelter to the next. It all comes out in the wash. Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and I found spots to pitch our tents and grabbed some dinner at the picnic table. Snail Mail got her trail name from the care packages she gets, as she’s taken the mail drop option for resupply. Her family is doing a lot to personalize each drop, which sounds awesome. It’d be nice to hang out with this crew for a little while.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Laughing Heart Hostel","end":274.9}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":22,"date":"2024-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Flint Mountain Shelter","end":308.8,"sleep":"Shelter","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":41,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_SLOW_DOWN","trainingReadiness":1},"html":"<p>Today I hiked more or less the whole day with Fire Magic. We made a stop for cookies — there were signs for a Cookie Lady about 5 miles into the day, and it was a short walk to a cabin. There was a policy of 1 free cookie, $2 for any additional — I won’t say how many cookies I ate, but it was the right amount. We also passed Big Butt Bypass toward the end of the day (the side trail names for this area are really getting me), and surpassed the 300 mile mark! There was the number 300 spelled out in a rock formation on the ground to mark the spot, and we managed to grab a photo of the milestone.</p>\n<p>At the shelter, Fire Magic reunited with Lost. Lost said that Fire Magic kept him going on the trail for a bit. It’s crazy how hikers intersect, separate, and come back together. Around the picnic table at dinner, I mentioned something about ursacks as I’m planning to switch to one in Virginia, and a dude in a kilt sitting around the fire interjected. Apparently his ursack was destroyed by the bear at Standing Indian, ripped at the seam, and he thinks now that ursacks are a ripoff. I was torn between feeling a bit sorry for this guy for having lost his food, and thinking that hanging an ursack to a tree at a shelter with a known bear problem was kind of a bad idea to begin with. I’m looking forward to swapping my big bulky heavy bear canister for an ursack when I get further north, but ursacks aren’t great protection against habituated bears. The dude was clearly mad so I didn’t push it, but Lost made a point of saying, you’re in the bear’s home, you can’t really be mad at him. Dude’s still mad, though I was happy to hear Lost say it.</p>\n<p>Phoenix, a German woman we had met yesterday hiking with her friend Fire, arrived and came in with us in the shelter, saving some space for Fire who should arrive shortly. But as bedtime came and Fire didn’t, I could sense Phoenix was concerned. With everyone else in the shelter sleeping or on their way, Phoenix sat upright, anxiously sighing and looking at her phone. I asked her from underneath my quilt if she was nervous about her friend; yes, she said, Fire should have arrived by now. They were carrying one inReach between them, and Phoenix was the one carrying it. She got a text a few hours ago, but hadn’t heard anything recently, and there wasn’t enough signal here to get a message out. I told her that if she decided she’d like to hike back to look for her, I’d be happy to walk with her. She took me up on the offer, and soon everyone in the shelter was awake, transitioning from sleeping shelter mates to willing search party members. I made a point of bringing my first aid kit with me, wondering how much I remembered from my wilderness first aid 2-day class. Luckily, we hadn’t hiked more than a half mile or so before Phoenix exclaimed that she had enough signal to send a message; a few minutes later, texts were exchanged with Fire, and it turned out that she had lost her way earlier, but was closing in on the shelter soon. A few minutes after that, we could see her headlamp in the distance, and there was a brief tearful reunion with hugs to go around. I was glad, mostly for Phoenix but also just happy not to have to discover just how much of my first aid training I had forgotten.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Spring Mountain Shelter","end":286.2}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":23,"date":"2024-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Bald Mountain Shelter","end":327.7,"sleep":"Shelter","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":66,"garminFeedback":"LISTEN_TO_YOUR_BODY","trainingReadiness":31},"html":"<p>There were happy goodbyes this morning as Phoenix and Fire were together again. Phoenix complimented me by calling me a dancer, and when I misunderstood and said that no, I’m not a dancer, she explained that I appear to dance when coming down the trail with my trekking poles. I took this as high praise, as I never really hiked with trekking poles before last year, and I’ve been working to get used to them.</p>\n<p>Fire Magic and I started the day out together, and hiked together for some of the first few miles. There was some really awesome trail magic around 3 miles in at Devil’s Fork, where I was able to grab some fresh fruit and bars but also snag some really well wrapped toilet paper. I stayed for maybe 30 minutes, waiting for one snack to digest before tearing into the next one, and talking so some of the really nice folks running the trail magic stand.</p>\n<p>I almost caught up to Fire Magic again (this time with Lost), as they were leaving yet another trail magic stop 12 miles in just as I was arriving. I’ll never refuse food, and an orange was definitely a welcome interruption. The trail angel asked me what my number was, referring to the number on my hang tag, and when I told him, he said he hadn’t seen anyone with a number that high yet. The numbers are sequential, so someone starting on January 1st might be #1 while I, starting on April 3rd, was 1961. The higher your number at any given spot, the faster you’re probably going relative to those around you, and most of the hikers I was hiking around had lower numbers and had started sometime in March. It’s tough to know really who’s ahead and who’s behind you, but I definitely feel like I’ve been going faster than a lot of people I’ve met.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, I had caught up to Fire Magic, and we took in the peak at the top of Big Bald. It was just Fire Magic, me, and a dude sitting in a tractor, staring out into the horizon. It really was a good view, but it was starting to get a little chilly, and we decided to make the 1.2 mile trek back here as a sunrise hike. The views this time would be infinitely better than Clingmans Dome.</p>\n<p>As we ate dinner at the picnic table, a hiker came in relatively late (just before sundown) and went off immediately to set up her tent. Her name was Rabbit, and I guess she had gotten the name from hiking big miles. I thought that I had done some big days, pushing past 20 miles a few times, but Rabbit I think started after me. No sooner had I puffed out my chest for having a high hang tag number than I met someone who most likely had a higher number than me. I tried peaking at Rabbit’s hang tag when she came back just to see how high the difference was, and was a bit ashamed of myself. I imagine Rabbit will probably speed right by and that’ll be that, but it was good to remind myself that there are people on all ends of things. <em>“This is a marathon, not a sprint.”</em></p>\n<p>Fire Magic and I stayed in the shelter so that we could pack up quickly in the morning, and we were the only two there. We chatted a bit about expectations for the trail, tramilies, and a bit of my inner fight between wanting to make connections along the way and wanting to stretch my legs. Fire Magic was not creating expectations around who she might hike with or for how long, and that makes sense. Some people you don’t see for a while but then reconnect out of the blue, she said, and some people you only hike with for a day and then never see again. But then she mentioned this one time when an older guy we both knew (someone I met only briefly at Fontana Dam) behaved pretty sketchily toward a younger woman we both knew. While I’ve enjoyed seeing the good and bad of people and being part of a trail community that tends to bring out the good in everyone, it was a bit disheartening to hear about the <em>other</em> side of someone who didn’t initially strike me as a bad dude, but appears now to have definitely behaved badly at times. And Fire Magic and I were both almost falling asleep by this time, but in my sleepy mind, I drew a distant parallel between that guy and myself, and wondered if Fire Magic was getting any bad behavior vibes from me. I was definitely too tired to ask or to try to redirect if that was the case, but I fell asleep with a feeling of wanting to avoid giving off the wrong impression.</p>"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"start":null,"destination":"Flint Mountain Shelter","end":308.8}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"day":24,"date":"2024-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","start":null,"destination":"Uncle Johnny's Hostel","end":344.5,"sleep":"Building","mood":"🙂","sleepScore":45,"garminFeedback":"TIME_TO_SLOW_DOWN","trainingReadiness":3},"html":"<p>The sunrise hike happened! It initially seemed as though it might be overcast, but we actually got some beautiful views.</p>\n<p>In my haste to get up for sunrise, I didn’t pull out any snacks for the day. A normal person would stop, take a moment to enjoy their surroundings, maybe? and take out some snacks from their pack before repacking and starting out again. But that would take too long, so I decided to bust out the first 10 miles of the day and figure out food at the first shelter. I caught up with Fire Magic at the top of the first hill, and there was a moment where she might have thought I would hike alongside her as I did the other day, but I explained poorly that I didn’t pack snacks very well so I was going to hike fast. Writing this now, I don’t think that makes any sense.</p>\n<p>Reflecting, I think there are maybe 3 reasons that I hiked fast this morning? One, because I get anxious about taking breaks when I could be moving, two, because Rabbit is an enigma and I’m curious if I could catch up to her, and three, I wonder if I may have given Fire Magic a weird impression last night. The fact that I have enough energy to get pretty poor sleep last night but still hike 10 miles without eating anything is just icing.</p>\n<p>I caught up to Rabbit just before Spivey Gap. She asked me if I saw this gigantic tree a little while back, and this interaction sticks with me because I missed it, and I conflate missing a gigantic tree with hiking too fast to notice the little (or big) things. But I guess it goes both ways, as I remarked to Rabbit about how quiet this gap was, and she said she didn’t notice on account of wearing headphones. I guess we all notice the things we notice.</p>\n<p>I passed Rabbit, but she leapfrogged me around a half mile before the shelter as I was getting water. I arrived at the first shelter and ate lunch before rearranging my pack and waited for Fire Magic to catch up. I originally anticipated hiking into Erwin with Fire Magic, but as she made her lunch, I reconsidered, wanting to get to Uncle Johnny’s soon so that I could get some chores done.</p>\n<p>While I was on the Long Trail, I saw one interaction that sort of redefined how I see thru hikers hiking together. As I was having breakfast with a guy, his friend announced he was planning to start walking for the day. The guy I was chatting with replied that he’d be ready in 20 minutes, after he finished his breakfast and hit the privy. I expected some sort of negotiation, either a “I can wait 20 minutes” or “I’ll eat quickly”, but instead, both did exactly what they said they were going to do, and hiked separately for the morning. I guessed that, when you’re hiking almost 2200 miles with someone, you don’t have to hike all of those miles together. But I’m a consensus-driven person by nature, and I’m still figuring out how to make decisions independently of the people around me.</p>\n<p>When I got to Uncle Johnny’s, I ran into Live Mas and Lost and caught up a bit. That bit about reconnecting with people you haven’t seen for a while is really true — I don’t think I’ve seen Live Mas since I met him at the Fontana Hilton. It was still raining, so I ended up holding off on chores, but Rabbit walked the two miles into town to pick up some cork so she could hand-carve her own insoles. That’s pretty badass. Fire Magic arrived shortly thereafter, and we did laundry together. The loaner clothes here aren’t quite as cool or comfy as those at Laughing Heart, but the outdoor shower was novel and felt good.</p>\n<p>We all went out for Mexican food. I think this might be the worst Mexican food I’ve had in my life, but as always I’m grateful for the calories, and the portions were large enough that I couldn’t even finish my meal. I think my hunger now outstrips the physical limitations of my stomach.</p>\n<p>Rabbit indeed does have a higher number than me, and started on April 6th. She lives in a converted school bus with oak floors, and makes her own pemican. She’s planning to do 20 to 30 miles a day. My wanting to get miles out of my body doesn’t in any way compare to her wanting to see how far she can push her body. I asked her about this war (that I’ve been fighting internally) between hiking socially and hiking aggressively. She said she’d like to meet a tramily that also does similar distances, but she doesn’t want to sacrifice movement. I feel similarly, even if our ideas of pushing ourselves are scaled differently. Fire Magic is planning to take a zero day tomorrow and reconnect with Snail Mail and Honeybuns. As cool as it would be to see the both of them, I don’t want to sacrifice movement, so I guess that means sacrificing hiking with Fire Magic, Snail Mail, and Honeybuns.</p>\n<p>Talking to Live Mas, I learned that not everybody is out here for the same reasons. (Shocking.) I mean, some people see this as a vacation, and when the days get hard or the weather turns sour, and they type 1 fun isn’t happening, they take a rest day and have fun off trail instead. I guess that makes sense, but if you wanted a vacation, why not a cruise, or hike the Camino de Santiago where your gear and meals are taken care of, instead of hiking with your tent on your back for 2200 miles? I came out here because home life is far too comfortable, and I want to be comfortable being uncomfortable. But we’re all out here for different reasons, at different life stages.</p>\n<p>We had this conversation in conjunction with my decision to tent in the rain, instead of staying in the bunks.

Next time, I’m taking the tent, even if it’s wet outside.</p>\n<p>Uncle Johnny’s has bikes for rent, and I went for a ride with Fire Magic and Live Mas to resupply, get coffee, and visit McD’s. It reminded me that not all bikes fit all people, and I think Fire Magic did the best job finding a bike that fits her, while Live Mas’ bike was practically a low rider. After getting back to Uncle Johnny’s and repacking my bag, I finally left the hostel at 3pm.</p>\n<p>The last time I left this late in the day, it was 7 miles uphill out of the NOC. And honestly, when I got to the first shelter some 4.5 miles in, I thought I might stop there for the day. But then when I arrived, I chatted with some section hikers that had planned to finish the day at Beauty Spot, another 6.5 miles in. I had read about Beauty Spot! I had even saved an article to my phone that said, if you’re going to camp anywhere on the AT, make sure to stop at Beauty Spot, where you can see both a great sunset and sunrise from your tent. I grabbed some water, and did some quick mental calculations, but that took too long so I just started walking and ran the numbers while on foot. It was 4:45pm, which left me relatively 3 hours or so to make 6.5 miles. And how many people might be there? It was a Saturday night, and the article said that this was a popular spot with the locals. I’d have to get there with enough time to find a good tent spot and get dinner before settling down to watch the sunset.</p>\n<p>Toward the last climb, I could feel the wind howling. I made it to the summit before 7pm, almost perfect timing, and I was surprised to see only 2 or 3 other tents there. Rereading the FarOut comments, it seemed as though maybe Beauty Spot used to be a spot where you could order delivery pizza, but now the roads here were closed. Sorry, locals! It was still windy, but one of the other tenters told me that, if I camp right next to a certain fire ring, the wind was significantly dampened by some trees. And so I set up tent where they mentioned, and enjoyed one of my finer ramen noodle packets under a beautiful sunset. I thought about the definition of luck. Before getting on trail, luck was when preparation meets opportunity, but now that I’m out here and I’ve prepared as much as I can, luck to me is an awareness of those opportunities and the flexibility to meet them. I was tired when I got to the shelter today, but as soon as I heard the section hikers talking about Beauty Spot, I wasn’t so set in stopping there that I couldn’t pivot.

It felt like when I was a kid and everybody’s backyard was my territory. After passing the first house or two though, the trail took a left turn onto the street, and I was into town, walking through a town park. I slowed down as I walked past the entrance sign. With Damascus as a trail icon, the home of the Trail Days festival, I had seen so many pictures of this sign, and now I was walking underneath it.</p>\n<p>I finished up at the Marathon gas station (so fitting), but I had to walk an extra block and then back to the hostel to make it an official 26.2.

It started raining as we stood outside a gas station, and one guy drove up just to tell us that he thought it might be illegal for us to hitchhike. Finally, someone who had just come from watching the Kentucky Derby picked us up and gave us a ride back.

I usually keep my phone in airplane mode, but I’ll take it out of airplane mode sometimes when I take photos and I want them to have location information. I had 2 bars, which is about as good as I ever have in the woods, so we tried calling.</p>\n<p>Maybe a bit of background. I’ve been at the same company for close to 9 years, but it’s gone through some changes, including an IPO and being acquired twice. They were cool enough about letting me take 90 days of personal leave to start the hike, but I wasn’t sure myself whether I’d be coming back. With the most recent acquisition, our little division of the company was getting restructured, and a number of people were let go, but I came through unscathed. It turns out that I made it past the first round or so, but I didn’t make it past them all. Ultimately, this is really good for me: it frees me up to finish the hike without having to worry about employment, and I think it comes with a severance package as well, which helps offset the cost of everything. This is maybe the best possible scenario for me, given that I’m out here caring more about being out on the trail than being gainfully employed.</p>\n<p>After the call, I caught up with Rabbit and Noah, and we celebrated. Hooray, I lost my job! I’m free!</p>\n<p>Today was the Grayson Highlands. All I knew about the Grayson Highlands is that they were maybe a little similar to the Roan Highlands, and that they had ponies. Both of these things turned out to be mostly true.

I’d like to think though that, if they had asked to be touched, I’d enjoy petting them.</p>\n<p>We also passed Mount Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia! I remember, just a few days ago, I could barely make out this mountain off in the distance, somewhere north. Now it’s to my south. Sometime after Rogers, we noticed that we had crossed the 500 mile mark without even noticing. We didn’t want to walk a mile back just to find it, so we created our own “501” mile marker.

At first it seemed like maybe my body might not need a ton of sleep out here, but it’s starting to wear on me, just a little bit.</p>\n<p>I saw a little side trail this morning with a sign that read “Museum”. Fluff and Rabbit kept walking, but I wanted to check it out, so I called ahead that I’d catch up, and followed the side trail. It was kind of cool! I guess it was part of the Settlers Museum; basically, it was a bunch of old farm machinery. But the main thought I had when checking it out was, I’m used to being able to go on side quests whenever I want to, and the dynamic has been a bit different the past few days. I’ve been focused on enjoying my time with Rabbit and Fluff, but I’m not sure right now how to fit in moments to enjoy myself.</p>\n<p>After checking out the museum, I caught up with Rabbit and Fluff, and we stopped at a gas station at a road crossing. The gas station had some kind of frozen milkshake machine, where you’d take a cup out of the freezer, put it in the machine, and it would stir it up. So fancy! Behind the counter, there was a listing of all the US presidents, and Trump’s face was pasted over Biden’s; we’re definitely in Trump country right now. There were some Trump t-shirts too.</p>\n<p>After filling up on sugar (which I’m sure we’ll burn off shortly), we walked over to an alpaca farm. I saw real live alpacas! This was a great rest stop — we did some laundry, we bought some food, got a ride into Walmart for a resupply, and gifted our leftover pizza to Eggs and Bacon.</p>\n<p>Taking a small step back — I don’t know when I first heard about Eggs and Bacon, but I’ve been seeing their names etched into shelters, signs, and the like for some time now. There were rumors about their backstory, but the only thing I knew definitively was that it was a dad (Bacon, I think?) hiking with his young daughter (Eggs?). Also, I guess they had made some kind of apology after being caught tagging one of the shelters in the Smokies, though there was some speculation over whether their apology was heartfelt. The other thing I know about Eggs and Bacon is, they stopped at the alpaca farm on the same day that we did. Rabbit and I had really tried to eat our leftover pizza from yesterday, but it was time to part with the remains, and the cheese was only going to stay fresh for so long inside of my bear canister. So I asked Bacon if they’d be interested; he asked Eggs if she wanted pizza, she said “heck yeah”, and our leftover pizza found a new home.</p>\n<p>I also bought some alpaca socks for my mom for Mother’s Day. It’s pretty easy for all the days to kind of run into each other, but Mother’s Day is at least one day I didn’t want to forget. I’m going to try to send the socks home when I ship back my winter gear.</p>\n<p>Virginia has been really pretty so far.

We stopped at Walmart for resupply, and packing out an apple pie just seemed like the right move.

I’m still trying to figure out how much food to buy — it seems as though the amount of calories that will fit in my bag is not enough calories to keep me from losing weight. At the cafe, I asked the woman behind the counter whether she could make an affogato — she didn’t know what it was, but when I told her that I think it’s just espresso plus ice cream, she said that could make both of those things!

After cleaning up, I walked down to the visitor center to check if I’d have enough time to hit up the grocery store before the trolley returned to the trailhead; it looked doubtful, so I decided to resupply at the outfitter’s instead. While I was there, a guy offered me a ride back to the trailhead without me even asking! The people here are SO NICE. On the way back, he talked about his hobby of overlanding, and we compared our experiences of getting away from it all for days (or months) at a time.</p>\n<p>I wrote a few days back about sometimes being underwhelmed by even the most epic Virginia views. Well, sometimes they still get me. Virginia really does have some pretty hills.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the trail, I’ve been kind of triangulating mileage based on how I feel, where others are landing, and the 3 itineraries available on the AT Guide website. When I started, the 15 mile plan was closest to my speed, but at least right now, the 18 mile plan seems closest to how far my legs want to go. But the plans are still pretty old, and today the 18 mile plan mentioned a shelter that doesn’t exist anymore. Turns out it’s been replaced by Whiskey Hollow shelter. I arrived a little on the late side, around 6:45pm.

This felt like the spot I might return to tomorrow morning, and that would have been the case if two things didn’t go dramatically wrong: (1) my shoes weren’t actually waiting for me at the post office, and (2) there weren’t any open beds in town this evening.</p>\n<p>I was kind of nervous about the shoes when I realized that REI had shipped them via UPS without really asking me. I wasn’t sure if a UPS package could be picked up from USPS, but the Internet wasn’t super conclusive.

I looked out by the loading dock anyway, just to see if maybe the shoes had escaped notice, but wherever my shoes had been left 3 days ago, they weren’t here now.</p>\n<p>I guess I’ll be walking some more miles on this same pair of shoes, which have carried me over 1000 miles and have a few holes in them.</p>\n<p>Also, I initially pictured Harpers Ferry as a quaint little town, darling halfway point of the Appalachian Trail. Now that I’m here on the first Saturday in June, I’m finding it to be a claustrophobic slice of American history tourism where all the beds have been taken by tourists interested in American history.

The problem is, they can’t ship them to a post office because these shoes ship directly from the vendor (Topo Athletic), and REI’s system doesn’t allow them to tell the vendor how to ship them. So I spent a good chunk of time trying to find a private address (hostel) that will accept packages and is the right distance away. Long story short, I’m going to have to hike 150 miles from where I started this morning to pick them up, and they’re not going to arrive until June 11th. That’s about 17 miles per day, far slower than what I’ve been used to.</p>\n<p>But I got to thinking: one of the reasons I was hiking so fast to begin with was to get ahead of the bubble. I don’t have to hike 20 miles a day, and I’m pretty sure I can be happy without that. This also makes it easier for Rabbit to catch up to me. So, if you discount the part about having to hike more than half the AT on a single pair of shoes, this is a win. With this newfound freedom, I ended up taking a few breaks today, including getting trail magic for a second time from a guy who had hiked the AT a few decades back, I think in the 70s. I sat for over 30 minutes, chilling out with two hikers named Martian and PBG (Peanut Butter Giant).</p>\n<p>At the shelter tonight, I talked about my shoes to a guy coming south (also a flip flopper, didn’t start in Maine), who had just come through PA. PA is kind of famous for having a lot of rocks, they even call it Rocksylvania. He said, as long as you get a new pair by Duncannon PA, I’ll be fine. I’ll get every nickel out of the shoes, but I’ll be fine. When I told him I wasn’t getting the shoes until some 30 miles after Duncannon, his face visibly dropped.</p>\n<p>Oh, but hey, I’m squarely in Maryland now?

Weird note: right before crossing the interstate, the trail cut right in between two houses, right next to someone’s driveway, and then right behind someone’s house.

He picks me up from the parking lot just outside of the zoo, and he seems nice, but as we’re pulling out, he sees a Hasidic Jew and makes an angry comment about how they’re running the world not paying their taxes. I was so incredibly uncomfortable, and I’m upset with myself for not just getting out of the car. As we kept driving, his conversation shifted to talking about some of the severe flooding that happened in New York last year, apparently by the same storm system that wrecked a good portion of Vermont. He talked about a bridge being washed out and a girl drowning. As he was talking through it, he was narrating his own need to find a target to blame, some cause for why bad things happen to good people. The only potential cause he could put words to was the Chinese, saying that the timing wasn’t too far off from the weather balloon incident.

Apparently he asks this question of a lot people, and while most say yes, a fair percentage of people say that others would answer no. I suppose that’s an interesting observation. Sparx thanked him for doing such a good job making RPH such a cool shelter to stay at, and mentioned that she’d like to do more trail magic here, which kicked off a long conversation/disagreement between the two over whether this is ok or not. It seems like the maintainer is more or less saying that doing trail magic at RPH falls into the law of unexpected consequences, and that there’s a significant chance that someone else might do a similar thing but without the good will and intention of cleaning up after themselves, ending up diminishing the things that make RPH a great shelter to begin with. After he left, most of the other hikers were mad at the maintainer, as Sparx’s actions had been well-intentioned and she was responsible about cleaning up after the group.

Before long, the woman from the next zone over had turned on her headlamp, as she was probably even <em>more</em> concerned about strange noises that weren’t accompanied by a light in the distance. I had no choice but to turn on my headlamp and walk to the privy. Ugh.</p>\n<p>Today was a good day! Good weather, pretty views. At one point in the morning I heard a lot of really loud cars in the distance, and I thought some local car enthusiasts were tearing up some local roads and I might have a hard time crossing the street — turns out, it was a local race track and I was able to get a good view of them from the hill. I stopped at the Mountainside Cafe for brunch with Bandit and Bluegrass, where (!!!) they were able to make me an affogato, even when it wasn’t on the menu.

They were planning to stay for a bit, but I was hoping to get back on trail before long. I got a ride back to the trail from a guy with leather armbands (I think from the local church?). It was threatening to thunderstorm, and he said the upcoming section was exposed and offered to let me stay at his place for a bit. As nice of a gesture as I’m sure that was, I didn’t know him, I didn’t know how far from the trail he was, and I had no desire to be dependent on someone else, so I declined. I get the sense he thought me a bit foolhardy. Sure enough, almost as soon as he pulled away, it started raining. Just a few drops, but big ones. A woman on a bike rode by, saying “it’s a bad day for hiking”, as if I picked today of all days to venture out. The rain started coming down heavier as the trail went into a field, and I ran for the cover of trees. I got my rain gear on, took stock, then hiked a bit, finding a small tree to hunker under. (Never the tallest tree, and never too close to the trunk.) I then walked a little further, resolving not to climb or leave tree cover, and I came across a privy by a trail head. I went in, rearranged my pack and ate a snack, and by the time I came out, the rain had settled down, and I hiked on.</p>\n<p>Eating inside a privy is probably adding another hole punch to my feral card, but as I see it, I didn’t touch anything.</p>\n<p>Going up Bear Mountain (CT edition) was super easy, but the descent was pretty sketchy, very tough and technical.

I sat down and recorded me humming it a bit while taking a break to refill water. It’s probably a weird combination of lack of sleep as well as being overwhelmed with completeness of an idea coming/fitting together, but I was tearing up a bit as I was going through it.

It was also basically just 7 miles of fairly dangerous rockstacles (rock obstacles? going with it), so most of the day hikers were taking their time, rightly so, and I didn’t want to just breeze past them.</p>\n<p>Also, did I mention that this section of trail is tough?! This was a long 10 miles. I remember though hiking a section last year close to Mount Adams on a MITOC day hike, and telling hikers that I too planned to hike the AT soon enough. Now here I am.</p>\n<p>I took a breather at the Madison Spring Hut, to grab some lemonade and sit down with some other thru hikers. A southbounder was telling a story about how he had hiked all day to get to Pinkham Notch, only to arrive at the visitors center who told him he wasn’t allowed to camp there. When he asked where he could camp, they said he had to hike a half mile back north, which he didn’t want to do, so he stealth camped just on the other side of the highway. Someone else was empathetic, but I found myself siding completely with the visitors center and getting frustrated with him. Maybe yesterday’s conversation bled into my feelings a bit too, but this just feels like thru-hiker entitlement; it doesn’t really matter how far he hiked that day, or how far he has to climb to reach a camping area, the rules were written before he arrived and he doesn’t have much of a right to be upset. But as I found myself getting upset, I excused myself and headed back to the trail.</p>\n<p>After getting up Madison and down below treeline, the last 1.5 miles were a pretty steep descent. Java arrived a bit before me, and Waffles and Hawkeye arrived a bit after. I think the day really took it out of them. I could tell they were a little frustrated, and I couldn’t imagine hiking a trail this long with my parents. So many opportunities to get into huge fights and not much space away from them to help mitigate. My heart goes out to them.</p>\n<p>I figured out why Gorham is on the 18 mile/day itinerary twice: you can get there either via Rt 16 or via Rt 2, and it’s ~20 miles between the two highways.

Initially I planned to shuttle into Gorham with Java and Stumbles, but when we (me, Beat Box, and the guy who doesn’t like the AMC) got to the base of the mountain, we met a trail angel/fan of Waffles’/Hawkeye’s YouTube channel who had agreed to give them a ride into town. He said he had enough room for the rest of us too, so I scored a free ride!</p>\n<p>While we were waiting for Waffles and Hawkeye to come down the mountain, we grabbed some breakfast at the Pinkham Notch visitors center. This was another spot that I think I’ve been to before. They have some old photos of the AMC huts back when they were new, and some of them pre-date the AT itself. I think this helped give some perspective that the AMC isn’t just capitalizing on federal land; instead, they took on the task of making these trails and building the huts far before the trail started getting the yearly AT traffic it does today, and they look after the land through a somewhat complex relationship with the government (at least, complex to me). He’s still not sure how he feels about paying to stay on federal land, but I think he realizes now that it wasn’t quite as simple as he originally made it out to be.</p>\n<p>Waffles and Hawkeye caught up to us shortly after breakfast, and we caught a ride into Gorham with the trail angel. We stopped to let Beat Box and friends out at the hostel they were staying at, and the trail angel gave us all some homemade blueberry pie to enjoy, topped with locally picked blueberries. He didn’t have any plates, but my hand did just fine, even if it was a bit sticky.</p>\n<p>There’s a dynamic I don’t quite understand around trail angels and trail vloggers. Waffles and Hawkeye are documenting their thru, and people like this trail angel are living vicariously through their videos, and in turn become kind of a fan base. The trail angel had brought a kind of sumptuous feast for them, including lobster rolls which can’t be all that cheap in NH, and thanked them repeatedly for what they do. I think what he means by that is first and foremost the hard work of hiking the AT, but I think what he really means is the work of documenting their hike and making it accessible. I gave up posting even photos of the trail on social media; it felt performative, and took energy away from the direct experience of being on trail and away from society. There’s a part of this dynamic that feels wrong to me, but it’s also an act of bartering: trading lobster rolls for an insight into the lived experience of trail life. I couldn’t ever partake in either side of this, but I think I empathize with it a bit more now.</p>\n<p>The trail angel was very giving of his time, and I walked a thin line around yogiing a trip to Walmart and a ride back to the trailhead. I spent about 3 hours off trail, but if it weren’t for this trail angel, it would have been the better part of the day, and I’m extremely grateful.</p>\n<p>The climb out of Pinkham Notch was about as steep as the descent into it, but my legs got up Wildcat just fine. I was kind of hoping to get another Work For Stay at Carter Notch hut, so I powered through and passed some guys at the gondola without stopping for longer than it took to eat a single clif bar. It turned out that some south-bounders snagged WFS before I could (of course), but the croo had a good suggestion on a stealth spot just outside of where the Forest Protection Area ends. I found a good tent spot and had some time to chill before bed, so I checked out “the remnants” on the advice of one of the other hikers. Apparently, Carter Dome, which is now rounded off, used to have a more angular peak, but the top of the mountain broke off years and years ago, and you can still see the remnants of that as a series of boulders at the base of the mountain.</p>\n<p>After I turned in for the night, I heard Chappy, Hawaii, and Red Maple arrive at the stealth spot.

None of this switchback crap, I just walked down one mountain and up another in less than 30 minutes. To be honest though, I could deal with a little bit less adrenaline and a few more switchbacks.</p>\n<p>One thing I’m definitely appreciating though is how Maine tends the trail. I didn’t really have much of an understanding of different trail maintenance organizations before coming out on the AT. I realized a few things though while being out here: northern PA sucked, Bear Mountain in NY shouldn’t have replaced a mountain with a set of stairs, and now, the Maine Appalachian Trail Club is finding a balance between kindness and ruggedness. I always thought I appreciated the “natural” ascents and descents of VT and NH, where a hill will have rocks arranged as if they had naturally been deposited there by a glacier thousands of years ago, at just the right distance away from each other. Maine has some places where the rocks are clearly placed by human hands, not by Mother Nature. But they’re definitely not the same hands that put all those steps on Bear Mountain. I don’t feel coddled by the trail like I sometimes felt in Connecticut. Instead, it’s rugged as fuck, but with a heart. Somehow, also, the trail manages to be a story teller of where you’re going, and the possibilities of where you could go. In Vermont, I could stand on Abraham and look south and see where I came from, and look north and see where I was headed, partly because the Green Mountains hug the ridgeline and there were few options to begin with. In Vermont, it was the mountains that told me where to go, but in Maine, it’s the trail. Coming down Baldpate, I could see the mountains laid out before me; I knew my future. I’m kind of in love, I’m definitely in awe.</p>\n<p>Coming down toward Dunn Cascades, I heard a big animal lumber through the woods ahead of me, cross the trail, and stop.

And the hiking community, New England included, has a pretty big problem around accessibility, so I don’t know why I’m defending the status quo. I think I’m just attached to my mountains. Maybe it’s Stockholm Syndrome. I also wonder if I’m just being disagreeable because I’m overtired. But it’s rubbed me the wrong way each time when people want the trail to conform to them.
