I guess a good night's sleep is helpful! I just crushed the Roan Highlands.

Roan Mountain was a super interesting start to the day, as the dense forest cover made me think about pulling out my headlamp, it was so dark. But then it descends directly down to a highway. After that, I was pretty much out of tree cover for the rest of the day.

On the first bald, there was one sign identifying all the mountains on the horizon within North Carolina, and on the other side, one sign identifying all the mountains in Tennessee. The trail itself walks the border between the states. It was such a clear day, over the Tennessee horizon, it was possible to make out Mount Rogers, the tallest peak in Virginia. It was kind of exciting to know that I'll be walking over Mount Rogers sometime soon.

While descending the last mountain, I passed a "Leaving North Carolina" sign. Even though the trail has been technically hugging the NC/TN border for a while now, I'm now free of NC, and into my third state!

My legs felt like they could have gone on, and I kind of wanted to crack 26.2, but not yet. At the end of the day, I decided to go with Mountain Harbour hostel, as it looks like they're supposed to have a good breakfast. As I was standing next to the highway looking at how best to get there, who should walk down the road toward me, but Brightside and Kyler? It really is a small world, or at least a small trail.

The hostel was a short 0.1 mile walk from the road. After not getting much in the way of sleep at Uncle Johnny's, this time I'd grab a tent. I struggled a bit getting stakes into the ground, but I made it happen, and went to grab some dinner. And speaking of a small world, who should come in but somebody I've hiked with from the [MIT Outing Club](https://mitoc.mit.edu)? His trail name is Pocket Hulk, and I have to practice calling him that so that I don't slip into first names. I hung out with Pocket Hulk and Hiawassee (named so because he managed to take the Hiawassee shuttle not just once but several times) for a little bit, but it's time to call it a night.
