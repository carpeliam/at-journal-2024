I couldn't sleep last night - I thought I could hear the bear taking down the bear bags! But when I woke up, everybody's bear bag was unharmed. Well, there was one casualty, but it was from a mini-bear: I accidentally left the baggy of freeze-dried strawberries in the shoulder strap pocket of my pack (outside my tent, in the vestibule), and a mouse chewed through it and ate all the strawberries. I wasn't too concerned about the strawberries, but I'm not crazy about the hole in the shoulder strap pocket. Oh well, I guess it needed to get "broken in".

It was nice and cool and misty. I made really good miles today: I went over 3 mountains of ~5000 or taller, and passed maybe 3 or 4 people along the way. And today, I crossed the 100 mile mark! There was a little "100" etched into the blaze of a tree to mark the occasion. I'm pushing ahead of the 15 mile/day plan as I heard there might be a thunderstorm coming and I didn't want to be on top of Albert Mountain (which has a very metal fire tower) in the middle of it. Luckily I made it to the shelter before the weather turned too badly. Given the impending weather though, I think tonight will be a stay-in-the-shelter night. Winds tonight are supposed to be super rough.

I was nervous that everybody else would have the same plan, and that it would be a tight squeeze at the shelter tonight (another reason to make good time so that I could get to the shelter early), but when I got there I realized I had nothing to worry about. This shelter is *huge*, with an upstairs loft. And everybody staying at the shelter is so cool. I introduced myself to one guy, and he looks at me straight-faced and says, "I'm dying." His trail name was "Dying". And his comedic delivery was perfect. I also played chess against Gambit (so named because he's carrying a portable magnetic chess set) - it was a really close game, and I had a potentially winning position as black, but I was content to finish with a draw. When each hiker would walk up to the shelter out of the weather, we'd give them a cheer, and I did the same when Austin rolled in. Tomorrow is the Franklin NC, the second resupply, and it'd be cool to check out a trail town with this crew.
