Tennessee continues to impress; I saw a cool broken down house alongside the trail this morning. And the surroundings just feel *different*. I don't know if I'm just projecting, but each state seems to take on an ever so slightly different geology. Yesterday, Tennessee gave me a babbling brook, and today, it gave me a roaring waterfall, and then it invited me to walk next to the falls for a bit. Tennessee is overdelivering for sure. I almost stepped on a turtle right after passing two hikers, so I waited for them to catch up so I could point the turtle out to them, and one of them commented that the turtle is NOBO. All he needs I guess is a hang tag.

Boots Off hostel seemed like a good spot to do the dry run rehearsal for the End-to-Enders panel, so I'm stopping here for the night, even though it's only 12:30pm. I set up my tent next to a chicken coop (which might be quieter in the morning than a highway or a guy with sleep apnea?) and went about getting situated, when who did I see but Gambit? Last time I saw him, I think, was right before the Smokies, when he was meeting up with his wife. Apparently, he had to go to the ER due to an unknown infection, and he's just waiting another day for the antibiotics (which don't do well with sunlight) to do their thing.

Not long after, Rabbit rolls in as well, and Noah, then Lost a little while later -- yet again, it really is a small trail. The hostel ran us to the supermarket (pretty poor bar selection, had to supplement from the gas station) and to McD's, and then back to the hostel. Around 6:30pm, I jumped on a zoom call (what technology!) with the End-to-Ender panelists, and we walk through how the real thing will actually happen. It was pretty surreal to talk about my LT experience while in the middle of the AT. Also, one of the other panelists is someone I met on the LT, Aimee! It was great to hear the diversity of different speakers; the GMC did a really good job sourcing people, and I feel proud to be a part of it.
