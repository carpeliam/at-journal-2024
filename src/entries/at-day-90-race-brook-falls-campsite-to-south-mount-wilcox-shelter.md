I'm pretty enamored with the trail through Massachusetts so far. I spent part of the morning trying to spot a Massachusetts license plate; the first few cars I saw had NY/CT plates, but finally I saw one, on the road next to a Shay's Rebellion monument. I'm home!

Massachusetts wooed me further with some lovely trail magic today, even if none of their chargers could fit my phone and there was a confused man who seemed to suggest that doing 40 miles a day on the LT was perfectly possible. Nothing's going to ruin my mood, this is all just lovely.

I was a little slow to snag a tent spot, so it's me and Hummingbird taking our chances with the mosquitos in the shelter. (Which is also lovely.) I thought everything might be fine until they started coming out to play after dinner. We'll see how it goes!
