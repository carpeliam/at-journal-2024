Marathon! And I crushed it.

Got started with the sunrise, right around 6:30am. I noticed after the first hour that I was keeping a 3.25 mile/hour pace; if I could keep this going, I could finish in about 8 hours. Just after a hill, I passed a guy named Trek coming the other way, and assumed he was a local. (We're not supposed to have southbounders just yet, I don't think?) I guess he's doing a section, but he's done this before, and had lots of stories to tell. I passed an old building with the AT logo painted big on the side.

I caught up with Brightside and Grave Digger as they were taking a break at the first water stop, and with Noah on one of the hills. I was moving pretty fast, but I never felt winded, it felt sustainable. Part of me tells myself that I needed to go fast so that I could get into town and make sure everything is ready for the panel tonight, but since pulling into Mountain Harbour, I've been wanting to stretch it just a little further over that 26.2 mile line.

Just after 1pm, I crossed into Virginia. Damascus, just 3.5 miles to go! Seemingly, the VA ground feels a little softer, with pine needles underfoot compared to Tennessee clay. Goodbye Tennessee with your beautiful waterways and nonexistent privies, hello Virginia. Let's see what you've got to offer. I've heard that it's the blues, but we'll see how it goes.

I came down the hill into Damascus an hour later, and it reminded me a bit of coming into Hot Springs, where you just walk into a trail town, except I could see backyards with pools with people in them. It felt like when I was a kid and everybody's backyard was my territory. After passing the first house or two though, the trail took a left turn onto the street, and I was into town, walking through a town park. I slowed down as I walked past the entrance sign. With Damascus as a trail icon, the home of the Trail Days festival, I had seen so many pictures of this sign, and now I was walking underneath it.

I finished up at the Marathon gas station (so fitting), but I had to walk an extra block and then back to the hostel to make it an official 26.2. As I opened the door and asked about checking in, everybody was so chill, but I had all the excitement of having just completed my first hiking marathon and the post-race comedown that comes with it.

The End-to-Ender panel went really well. The questions were great, the enthusiasm was great, and the photo slideshow at the end brought it all together. Such a crazy moment, celebrating the potentials of Long Trail adventures for the attendees, while celebrating reaching the ceremonial halfway point of the AT.

Also, this hostel has a piano. I may have played it a little bit.

Noah and Rabbit convinced me to zero. (Rabbit may have compared my lack of zeros so far to self flagellation.) I guess my legs are a bit tired, I could use some sleep, and I'm kind of curious what a day's rest will be like.
