Planned to shuttle into Gorham with Java and Stumbles, but met a trail angel/fan of Waffles /son s YouTube
channel who gave me and others some homemade blueberry pie and a ride into town, a ride to Walmart, then a
ride back to the trailhead. I hiked on to Carter Hut, but they were already full for Work For Stay, so they
suggested I hike down the Wildcat River trail, and there was a tent stealth spot just after where the Forest
Protection Area ended.
