The trail provides! Initially I planned to shuttle into Gorham with Java and Stumbles, but when we (me, Beat Box, and the guy who doesn't like the AMC) got to the base of the mountain, we met a trail angel/fan of Waffles'/Hawkeye's YouTube channel who had agreed to give them a ride into town. He said he had enough room for the rest of us too, so I scored a free ride!

While we were waiting for Waffles and Hawkeye to come down the mountain, we grabbed some breakfast at the Pinkham Notch visitors center. This was another spot that I think I've been to before. They have some old photos of the AMC huts back when they were new, and some of them pre-date the AT itself. I think this helped give some perspective that the AMC isn't just capitalizing on federal land; instead, they took on the task of making these trails and building the huts far before the trail started getting the yearly AT traffic it does today, and they look after the land through a somewhat complex relationship with the government (at least, complex to me). He's still not sure how he feels about paying to stay on federal land, but I think he realizes now that it wasn't quite as simple as he originally made it out to be.

Waffles and Hawkeye caught up to us shortly after breakfast, and we caught a ride into Gorham with the trail angel. We stopped to let Beat Box and friends out at the hostel they were staying at, and the trail angel gave us all some homemade blueberry pie to enjoy, topped with locally picked blueberries. He didn't have any plates, but my hand did just fine, even if it was a bit sticky.

There's a dynamic I don't quite understand around trail angels and trail vloggers. Waffles and Hawkeye are documenting their thru, and people like this trail angel are living vicariously through their videos, and in turn become kind of a fan base. The trail angel had brought a kind of sumptuous feast for them, including lobster rolls which can't be all that cheap in NH, and thanked them repeatedly for what they do. I think what he means by that is first and foremost the hard work of hiking the AT, but I think what he really means is the work of documenting their hike and making it accessible. I gave up posting even photos of the trail on social media; it felt performative, and took energy away from the direct experience of being on trail and away from society. There's a part of this dynamic that feels wrong to me, but it's also an act of bartering: trading lobster rolls for an insight into the lived experience of trail life. I couldn't ever partake in either side of this, but I think I empathize with it a bit more now.

The trail angel was very giving of his time, and I walked a thin line around yogiing a trip to Walmart and a ride back to the trailhead. I spent about 3 hours off trail, but if it weren't for this trail angel, it would have been the better part of the day, and I'm extremely grateful.

The climb out of Pinkham Notch was about as steep as the descent into it, but my legs got up Wildcat just fine. I was kind of hoping to get another Work For Stay at Carter Notch hut, so I powered through and passed some guys at the gondola without stopping for longer than it took to eat a single clif bar. It turned out that some south-bounders snagged WFS before I could (of course), but the croo had a good suggestion on a stealth spot just outside of where the Forest Protection Area ends. I found a good tent spot and had some time to chill before bed, so I checked out "the remnants" on the advice of one of the other hikers. Apparently, Carter Dome, which is now rounded off, used to have a more angular peak, but the top of the mountain broke off years and years ago, and you can still see the remnants of that as a series of boulders at the base of the mountain.

After I turned in for the night, I heard Chappy, Hawaii, and Red Maple arrive at the stealth spot. They somehow managed to find spots for 3 tents in an area where there really wasn't any great spots to be had. They might not always be quiet when they get into camp late, but I'll definitely grant them some ingenuity in making the best out of a less than stellar campsite.
