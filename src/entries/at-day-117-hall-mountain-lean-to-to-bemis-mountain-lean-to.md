Today was a nice resupply, even if it was a little expensive. There was basically only one place in town (two, if you count the ice cream shop), so it was pretty easy to decide how to spend our time. We spent most of the day either eating food inside at a table or snacking on food outside at a picnic bench. There was one especially "trail provides" moment when Bonk was exclaiming to DK and me that he just realized the post office was a mile or so away; not that a mile would be too far to walk, but it would definitely eat into the day time-wise. A few minutes later, a perfect stranger drives up and asks us (1) are we thru hiking the AT, (2) what's our trail name, (3) do we need anything. A few minutes later, Bonk is in their truck on the way to the post office, and back again shortly thereafter. Just a lovely town.

While in town, I texted with Ted about when I thought I'd make it to Katahdin. I've had a Google spreadsheet with planned mileage and dates ever since I was planning to get together with John somewhere in New England. I can make changes offline and it syncs whenever I have signal, so it's been a good way to share plans. I sent Ted a link to the spreadsheet, with caveat words like "notional" to say "I have no idea when I'm summiting, but this spreadsheet thinks it's August 15th".

This afternoon, as we were coming off the last mountain, I caught out of the corner of my eye the most gorgeous view of lakes out into the distance. Damn, Maine, you've got it going *on*.

Rabbit has finally caught up with me!! We've been texting back and forth; for a little while, I was even drawing up a spreadsheet of where I was planning to get to, in the hopes that it'd make it easier to plan how to meet up. And then it just happened that both of us were heading to Bemis Lean-to tonight; I didn't even realize she was headed here for tonight until after leaving Andover. And now that she's caught up, there's a lot to catch up on!
