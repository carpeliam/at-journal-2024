Last night I stayed in the shelter to see how bad the mosquitos were, and I think the rain largely kept them
away, though there were a few
Went to coffee shop and grocery store in Salisbury, hung out with Bandit and Bluegrass and other hikers- got
ride back to trail from guy with leather armbands I think from the local church- it was threatening to
thunderstorm and he said the upcoming section was exposed and offered to let me stay at his place for a bit,
but I got on the trail. Almost as soon as I did, it started raining a bit. A woman on a bike went by, saying "it's a
bad day for hiking". The rain started coming down heavier as the trail went into a field, and I kind of ran for the
trees. I got my rain gear on, took stock, then hiked a bit, finding a small tree to hunker under. I then walked a
little further, resolving not to climb or leave tree cover, and I came across a privy by a trail head. I went in,
rearranged my pack, and by the time I came out, the rain had settled down, and I hiked on.

Coming down Bear Mountain was pretty sketchy, very tough and technical. I kept on trying to figure out, was it
going to rain again? Where, when, how much? Got to MA, And the Sage Ravine is gorgeous. MA trail so far
seems a little bit like NH, but a lot like home. Met some thru hikers who had started in Pawling who said it might
not rain after all, and I'd be at the shelter in 90 minutes. I think this bordered on irresponsible advice, but he
meant well. I got over the first mountain, but stopped at a campground because it was threatening to
thunderstorm, and the next mountain might take a bit. Longest short day in memory, the trail is getting hard
again!
