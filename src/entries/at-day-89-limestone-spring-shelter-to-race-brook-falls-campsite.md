I'm home! In my home state, at least. The shelter worked out pretty well last night! There were some mosquitos, but not too many.

Today I resupplied in Salisbury. The coffee shop had these nice little linen seat cushions, and when I got up to leave, I noticed mine was a bit dirtier than the others. You can't take me anywhere!

After grabbing groceries, I hung out with Bandit and Bluegrass and other hikers. They were planning to stay for a bit, but I was hoping to get back on trail before long. I got a ride back to the trail from a guy with leather armbands (I think from the local church?). It was threatening to thunderstorm, and he said the upcoming section was exposed and offered to let me stay at his place for a bit. As nice of a gesture as I'm sure that was, I didn't know him, I didn't know how far from the trail he was, and I had no desire to be dependent on someone else, so I declined. I get the sense he thought me a bit foolhardy. Sure enough, almost as soon as he pulled away, it started raining. Just a few drops, but big ones. A woman on a bike rode by, saying "it's a bad day for hiking", as if I picked today of all days to venture out. The rain started coming down heavier as the trail went into a field, and I ran for the cover of trees. I got my rain gear on, took stock, then hiked a bit, finding a small tree to hunker under. (Never the tallest tree, and never too close to the trunk.) I then walked a little further, resolving not to climb or leave tree cover, and I came across a privy by a trail head. I went in, rearranged my pack and ate a snack, and by the time I came out, the rain had settled down, and I hiked on.

Eating inside a privy is probably adding another hole punch to my feral card, but as I see it, I didn't touch anything.

Going up Bear Mountain (CT edition) was super easy, but the descent was pretty sketchy, very tough and technical. I kept on trying to figure out, was it going to rain again? Where, when, how much?

Immediately after entering MA, I came up on Sage Ravine, and it's gorgeous. I'm smitten already. MA trail so far seems a little bit like NH, but a lot like home. Along the way I met some thru hikers who had started in Pawling who said it might not rain after all, and I'd be at the shelter in 90 minutes. I think this bordered on irresponsible advice, but he meant well.

Initially I wanted to get to the first shelter in MA, which falls after 2 peaks. I got to the first peak and took a look around, and the storm clouds looked like they were headed my way. There was a campground in between the peaks, so I settled for that rather than take my chances with the storm. My mom and John would have been proud.

This was the longest "short" day in some time that I can remember - the trail is getting hard again!
