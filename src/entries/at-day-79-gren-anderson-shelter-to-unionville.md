Baby Kong didn't do so well in the shelter last night. Bugs ate him alive. I don't know when I'll try giving shelters another shot, but definitely not any time soon. It was just the three of us at the shelter last night. iMom came by but pressed on. It feels weird for the trail to be this empty, and nobody knows where the bubble is now.

It was so hot today, I had an unintentional siesta inside High Point State Park. I had caught up to Colonel who was just leaving - I went in with the intention to fill up my water, buy a cold drink, and sit down for a bit, and ended up falling asleep on a bench.

I was initially planning to stay at the Secret Shelter tonight, mostly because it's called the Secret Shelter. The grass was too tall though to support a tent, and the shelter itself was a heat trap. I hung out for a few minutes to read and sign the guestbook, and I felt like a dog left in a hot car for too long. While I was there I noticed a tick had hitched a ride on me - my first tick of the whole hike. So I pressed on to Unionville.

Unionville's a cute town! (And they have affogato on the menu!) I'm camped in the park next to the post office, and it's not all that great - I accidentally set up my tent in the exact spot where the flood lights are pointing, and there's a bell that chimes every hour, all night long. It's ironic how the closer I am to civilization, the worse my sleep tends to be.
