Up and over Washington! That was the easy part, then came the descent. Stayed at LotC for free breakfast
leftovers, then ate SO MUCH at Mt Washington visitors center, then hiked 7 miles of fairly dangerous
rockstacles (rock obstacles? Going with it) followed by 1.5 miles of steep descent. Long day, legs are tired,
sleep now.
