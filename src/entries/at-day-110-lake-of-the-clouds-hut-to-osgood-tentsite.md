I went up and over Washington this morning! I stayed at LotC until just before 9am for free breakfast leftovers, then ate SO MUCH at Mt Washington visitors center. I got there before 10am, but they didn't start serving pizza/lunch until later, so I ended up going back for multiple meals. I don't even want to know how much I paid. It was windy, cloudy, and a bit rainy when I first arrived, but the clouds cleared up after a meal or two, so I went out and got my summit photo a second time.

I remember going up Clingmans Dome and thinking, "this is so easy, wait until we get to Mount Washington!" but this morning was by far the easiest ascent up Mount Washington I've experienced. It helps a lot that it was only a mile and a half. That was the easy part; the rest of the day was basically a long descent, punctuated by lesser Presidentials.

Today was the Seek the Peak fundraiser, so the trail was *crowded*. The AT avoids the actual peaks for most of the Presis, and I'm kind of glad it does, as the peak bypass sections of the trail were far less crowded. I'm glad that folks are getting out here on the trail for their weekend, but the amount of stop-and-go action around the Presis got to be a bit brutal. It was also basically just 7 miles of fairly dangerous rockstacles (rock obstacles? going with it), so most of the day hikers were taking their time, rightly so, and I didn't want to just breeze past them.

Also, did I mention that this section of trail is tough?! This was a long 10 miles. I remember though hiking a section last year close to Mount Adams on a MITOC day hike, and telling hikers that I too planned to hike the AT soon enough. Now here I am.

The last 1.5 miles were a pretty steep descent. Java arrived a bit before me, and Waffles and Hawkeye arrived a bit after. I think the day really took it out of them. I could tell they were a little frustrated, and I couldn't imagine hiking a trail this long with my parents. So many opportunities to get into huge fights and not much space away from them to help mitigate. My heart goes out to them.

I figured out why Gorham is on the 18 mile/day itinerary twice: you can get there either via Rt 16 or via Rt 2, and it's ~20 miles between the two highways. Tomorrow, I'm planning to get into Gorham at Rt 16, maybe with Waffles and Hawkeye. We'll see what tomorrow brings. Long day, legs are tired, sleep now.
