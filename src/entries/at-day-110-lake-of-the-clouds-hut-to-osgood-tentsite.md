I went up and over Washington this morning! I stayed at LotC until just before 9am for free breakfast leftovers, then ate SO MUCH at Mt Washington visitors center. I got there before 10am, but they didn't start serving pizza/lunch until later, so I ended up going back for multiple meals. I don't even want to know how much I paid. It was windy, cloudy, and a bit rainy when I first arrived, but the clouds cleared up after a meal or two, so I went out and got my summit photo a second time. I also texted with Ted, and he said he'd come pick me up from Katahdin! Logistics win!

I remember going up Clingmans Dome and thinking, "this is so easy, wait until we get to Mount Washington!" but this morning was by far the easiest ascent up Mount Washington I've experienced. It helps a lot that it was only a mile and a half. That was the easy part; the rest of the day was basically a long descent, punctuated by lesser Presidentials.

Today was the Seek the Peak fundraiser, so the trail was *crowded*. The AT avoids the actual peaks for most of the Presis, and I'm kind of glad it does, as the peak bypass sections of the trail were far less crowded. I'm glad that folks are getting out here on the trail for their weekend, but the amount of stop-and-go action around the Presis got to be a bit brutal. It was also basically just 7 miles of fairly dangerous rockstacles (rock obstacles? going with it), so most of the day hikers were taking their time, rightly so, and I didn't want to just breeze past them.

Also, did I mention that this section of trail is tough?! This was a long 10 miles. I remember though hiking a section last year close to Mount Adams on a MITOC day hike, and telling hikers that I too planned to hike the AT soon enough. Now here I am.

I took a breather at the Madison Spring Hut, to grab some lemonade and sit down with some other thru hikers. A southbounder was telling a story about how he had hiked all day to get to Pinkham Notch, only to arrive at the visitors center who told him he wasn't allowed to camp there. When he asked where he could camp, they said he had to hike a half mile back north, which he didn't want to do, so he stealth camped just on the other side of the highway. Someone else was empathetic, but I found myself siding completely with the visitors center and getting frustrated with him. Maybe yesterday's conversation bled into my feelings a bit too, but this just feels like thru-hiker entitlement; it doesn't really matter how far he hiked that day, or how far he has to climb to reach a camping area, the rules were written before he arrived and he doesn't have much of a right to be upset. But as I found myself getting upset, I excused myself and headed back to the trail.

After getting up Madison and down below treeline, the last 1.5 miles were a pretty steep descent. Java arrived a bit before me, and Waffles and Hawkeye arrived a bit after. I think the day really took it out of them. I could tell they were a little frustrated, and I couldn't imagine hiking a trail this long with my parents. So many opportunities to get into huge fights and not much space away from them to help mitigate. My heart goes out to them.

I figured out why Gorham is on the 18 mile/day itinerary twice: you can get there either via Rt 16 or via Rt 2, and it's ~20 miles between the two highways. Tomorrow, I'm planning to get into Gorham at Rt 16, maybe with Waffles and Hawkeye. We'll see what tomorrow brings. Long day, legs are tired, sleep now.
