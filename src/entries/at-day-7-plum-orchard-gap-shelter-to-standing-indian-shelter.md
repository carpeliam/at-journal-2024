Today was the first rainy day on the trail, *and* I crossed a state line! Another few milestones. As I was figuring out the best way to pack up my wet tent (solution: the same as normal, except wetter), I found a tent stake in the mud left over at the tent closest to mine. Some guys waiting out the rain by the shelter said she left just a little bit before me, so I did the best I could to catch up - but I didn't get a tenth of the mile up the trail before realizing I had left my inReach satellite device back at the tent site. I definitely can't be losing things like that, not this early! I ended up catching up to the tent stake's proper owner about 4 miles in, just before we got to the Georgia/North Carolina state border. We both spent a few minutes desperately trying to unlock our phones to in order to take a photo, but it was so wet that the touch screen wasn't registering my finger very well. Finally, I got mine open, and we both took a photo with the sign. I'll have to send her photo when I get into town. Right after the border was this really cool tree that I've seen pictures of in other peoples' journals, but I didn't realize that it was in this part of the trail! Even though it was wet, it was exciting to cross into North Carolina, and none of the mud here is anything like what I saw in Vermont last year.

I met Austin, and we were both thinking of heading to Standing Indian Shelter tonight. I got there a little bit before him, and started chatting to the two guys in the shelter, telling them that I was planning to tent (my tent was already wet), but Austin was planning to stay in the shelter with them. One of the guys started saying that Austin better not keep his food in the shelter, because he's not going to be a party to some bear coming in and ruining the place. He went on for a little while about other people not appreciating bear safety, without any prompt from me. The guy just seemed irritated about just about everything. Somehow he found his way to complaining about how the White Mountains were not nearly as grandiose as everyone made them out to be. His friend, on the other hand, was a gentle soul, but also in rough shape - he was upset with his pants, but felt compelled to wear them because his wife had gifted them to him and he didn't want to let her down. When Austin arrived a little while later, the first guy was still getting upset about everything, and Austin looked at me so as to say, "are you getting a weird vibe from him too?" And I gave him back a look that said, yep, I'm getting the same vibe. I'm definitely tenting tonight, there's too much weird energy going on with these two.

All of the shelters I stayed at in Georgia had bear boxes. Standing Indian has a strongly worded letter, stapled to a tree. "BEAR ALERT". I'm pretty sure I'll be fine given I have a bear canister, but the FarOut comments say there's a problem bear in the area, and he can even crack a PCT bear hang. We'll see what the morning brings.
