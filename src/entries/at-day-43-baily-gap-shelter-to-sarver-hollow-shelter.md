Saw some cool undercasts today on Wind Rock! And I took a little side trail to some high cliffs where I spotted some kind of gigantic bird pruning itself, but I couldn't get close enough to see just what kind. Standing on this cliff was maybe the first time I've felt like, if I took a fall, it'd be a long way to recovery. Good thing I didn't fall.

Virginia isn't actually flat, but it probably spends more time being relatively flat than some of the other states. That being said, it invites you out into these wide valleys where you get a beautiful view of everything around you, with forest to one side and the rest of the world to the other. Really pretty.

I saw cows today! They were close by and mobile, so I did kind of a shit job at getting photos of them. But cows are pretty cool.
