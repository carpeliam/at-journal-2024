I saw what I think is my first undercast today! And then I took a little side trail to some high cliffs where I spotted some kind of gigantic bird pruning itself, but I couldn't get close enough to see just what kind. Standing on this cliff was maybe the first time I've felt like, if I took a fall, it'd be a long way to recovery. Good thing I didn't fall.

Virginia isn't actually flat, but it probably spends more time being relatively flat than some of the other states. That being said, it invites you out into these wide valleys where you get a beautiful view of everything around you, with forest to one side and the rest of the world to the other. Really pretty.

I saw 'Roid again and met Fish Stick today, having lunch at War Spur shelter. They happened to mention while chatting that they had both been passed by Rabbit, and how fast she was; I had to tell them that she had to get off trail, and I wasn't sure if she'd be back. I ended up passing Fish Stick later on in the day - he was moving at a good clip, and I felt compelled for some reason to keep up, and I guess I wore him down, as he ended up giving way to me. I didn't mean to be competitive, but sometimes it comes out.

I saw cows today! They were close by and mobile, so I did kind of a shit job at getting photos of them. But cows are pretty cool.

I spent enough time today out of the trees to see storm patterns (plus, atweather.org predicted them), and they caught up with me at the end of the day. I didn't really want to make the steep 0.3 mile descent down to Sarver Hollow Shelter (and I'm not excited about making the steep ascent in the morning), but when I arrived I discovered it's actually a great shelter to wait out the rain! It was a barn of a shelter, with plenty of room to hang things to dry. There was also some good camaraderie as we were all stuck here in the wet. Altogether a pretty good end to the day.
