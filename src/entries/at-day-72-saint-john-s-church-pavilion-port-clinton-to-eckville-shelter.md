Pulpit and Pinnacle were nice. Spent a few minutes talking to a couple of day hikers who had lots of questions
about the AT, who wanted to make it to Pinnacle but didn t have time. Spent some time ruminating about how
northern PA has all the downsides of wilderness areas, plus all the downsides of urban areas, and none of the
upsides- then the last mile before Eckville made a left turn into nice territory, and I remembered that, yeah, I DO
like hiking.
