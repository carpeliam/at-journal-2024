I got breakfast in town this morning before getting a bit of a late start on the day. Pulpit and Pinnacle were nice. I spent a few minutes talking to a couple of day hikers who had lots of questions about the AT, who wanted to make it to Pinnacle but didn't have time. I also spent some time ruminating while walking about how northern PA seems to have all the downsides of wilderness areas (not many blazes, not terribly well supported), plus all the downsides of urban areas (noise pollution, other forms of pollution), and none of the upsides; but then, the last mile before Eckville made a left turn into nice territory, and I remembered that, yeah, I actually DO like hiking.

Eckville itself was interesting. I guess it's an old house that was converted into a shelter, and I'm not really sure who owns it. I tented on one of the tent platforms, but the grass there is actually taller than everything else around it. iMom is also here for the night.
