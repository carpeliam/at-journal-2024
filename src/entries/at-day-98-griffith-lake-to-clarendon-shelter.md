Today felt a little slower, maybe a little hotter, than some other days, but I made a good detour. In the spirit of making the time, I made it to the White Rocks lookout, and it was really pretty! I'm glad I came out. This was another spot I skipped last year. The whole section around it, at the rock garden and with the tall pines, is just so pretty. It just puts me at ease.

It's supposed to storm sometime soon, remnants of Hurricane Beryl. I don't know if it's going to start tonight or not, but I think a few people are nervous about going over Killington tomorrow, given it's the first 4ker. We'll do the best we can!
