I opened a log book expecting to find a sign in sheet, but found individual cards instead, and felt compelled to
write poetry. I think I said something like,
What is the universe but dying,
But it's ours, if only for this moment?

Interesting trail magic at RPH from Sparx, who finished the trail a few weeks ago. She's writing a book about
how the politics of division (the division of politics?) is biological, baked into our lower level thinking that seeks
to compartmentalize. Maintainer asks everyone if they think people are nice- most say yes, but a fair
percentage say that others say no.
