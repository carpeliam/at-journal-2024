Some days it feels like I'm just walking from a shelter on the side of one mountain to a different shelter on the side of a different mountain. This morning, I walked over the Hudson River.

One of the New York trail aspects people talk about is deli blazing, where you're supposed to be able to get all your calories from just visiting a NY deli. This sounds amazing, but I've been trying to figure out the logistics a bit - where are the delis? How many are there, and how do I time them right? Today was an exercise in "don't overthink it", as the trail literally goes right by a deli called "Appalachian Market". I was able to order hot food, drink a cold gatorade, and round off my snack collection. I ran into Freedom and Dax while I chilled out for a while.

It's still hot, but not quite as hot during the day as it was when I was in New Jersey, and I was able to make decent time. I've been using the log books to see how far ahead of me people are, and I opened a log book expecting to find a sign-in sheet, but found individual cards instead, and felt compelled to write poetry. I think I said something like,
> What is the universe but dying, \
> But it's ours, if only for this moment
Or something like that. I tried to remember the inspired thought as I walked away but I don't think I got it quite right.

Interesting trail magic at RPH shelter from Sparx, a thru hiker who finished the trail a few weeks ago. She's writing a book about how the politics of division (the division of politics?) is biological, baked into our lower level thinking that seeks to compartmentalize. I ordered a pizza because I could, but there was so much food here, I didn't manage to finish my side, and ended up giving the rest to a guy named Bridger. The maintainer stopped by and had a question for the group: do they think people are nice? Apparently he asks this question of a lot people, and while most say yes, a fair percentage of people say that others would answer no. I suppose that's an interesting observation. Sparx thanked him for doing such a good job making RPH such a cool shelter to stay at, and mentioned that she'd like to do more trail magic here, which kicked off a long conversation/disagreement between the two over whether this is ok or not. It seems like the maintainer is more or less saying that doing trail magic at RPH falls into the law of unexpected consequences, and that there's a significant chance that someone else might do a similar thing but without the good will and intention of cleaning up after themselves, ending up diminishing the things that make RPH a great shelter to begin with. After he left, most of the other hikers were mad at the maintainer, as Sparx's actions had been well-intentioned and she was responsible about cleaning up after the group. But I think I side with the maintainer: the hikers moving along the trail never get the perspective of seeing how a single place changes with different hikers' passing.

The privy here smells absolutely terrible, but the artwork and ambiance makes up for it.
