I'm in Maine! I crossed the last state border! No more! I'm in Maine!

The section around the border was probably the worst mud I've seen on trail so far. The bog boards were all rotted out, but somehow I managed to make it through relatively unscathed. This part of the trail is definitely as rugged as any other part of the trail so far.

I made it to the shelter fairly early, but I didn't want to go through Mahoosuc Notch at the end of the day (who knows how long it would take), so I laid up at the last shelter. I talked to some southbounders about the Hundred Mile Wilderness - I guess, while you can work out food caches ahead of time (some kind of thru hiker DoorDash but for resupply), coordinating it was pretty hard, or at least, it was a pain in the ass for these people.

Songbird and Ovenbird ended up tenting in the same area tonight. I sang along with Songbird to Fiona Apple's "Paper Bag" and the Mamas and Papas' "100 Miles" while she played the guitalele. God bless her for putting up with my harmonies, my voice is terribly out of shape and I barely remember these songs but we made it work. As is turns out, she knows the Boston music scene better than I do.
