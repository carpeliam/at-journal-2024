I found a tick on my tent this morning, luckily easily visible (but how many are there that I *can't* see?!) - Gambit had one too on his tent, and he thinks they're Lone Star ticks. I guess it's a good thing it was on the outside of the tent, then.

Gambit is aiming at getting to a brewery on Friday, which is not a thing I'm all that interested in, but I'm down to hang out and hike together at least until then. Today, we resupplied in Glasgow. Glasgow was great! We had maybe the easiest hitch ever, and it had pretty good options. Just one "Grocery Express", but it had everything I needed at decent prices. There's technically a "shelter" in the center of town, with electrical outlets, a shower, firewood for a fire (the mayor kept bringing more), and some light trail magic. Seems like a nice way for the town to attract hikers.
