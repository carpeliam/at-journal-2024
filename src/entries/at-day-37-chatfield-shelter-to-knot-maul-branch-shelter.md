Last night, there was a pretty good thunderstorm, and I woke up once or twice in the middle of the night. I'm such a light sleeper, and I don't know how many times I've slept through the whole night on trail - probably not that many. At first it seemed like maybe my body might not need a ton of sleep out here, but it's starting to wear on me, just a little bit.

WAIT WAIT WAIT put stuff here about the museum


This trail is pretty awesome. Case in point, today we hung out with alpacas. About 5 miles in, we stopped at a gas station,
