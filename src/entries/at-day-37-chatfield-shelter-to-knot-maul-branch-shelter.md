Last night, there was a pretty good thunderstorm, and I woke up once or twice in the middle of the night. I'm such a light sleeper, and I don't know how many times I've slept through the whole night on trail - probably not that many. At first it seemed like maybe my body might not need a ton of sleep out here, but it's starting to wear on me, just a little bit.

I saw a little side trail this morning with a sign that read "Museum". Fluff and Rabbit kept walking, but I wanted to check it out, so I called ahead that I'd catch up, and followed the side trail. It was kind of cool! I guess it was part of the Settlers Museum; basically, it was a bunch of old farm machinery. But the main thought I had when checking it out was, I'm used to being able to go on side quests whenever I want to, and the dynamic has been a bit different the past few days. I've been focused on enjoying my time with Rabbit and Fluff, but I'm not sure right now how to fit in moments to enjoy myself.

After checking out the museum, I caught up with Rabbit and Fluff, and we stopped at a gas station at a road crossing. The gas station had some kind of frozen milkshake machine, where you'd take a cup out of the freezer, put it in the machine, and it would stir it up. So fancy! Behind the counter, there was a listing of all the US presidents, and Trump's face was pasted over Biden's; we're definitely in Trump country right now. There were some Trump t-shirts too.

After filling up on sugar (which I'm sure we'll burn off shortly), we walked over to an alpaca farm. I saw real live alpacas! This was a great rest stop - we did some laundry, we bought some food, got a ride into Walmart for a resupply, and gifted our leftover pizza to Eggs and Bacon.

Taking a small step back - I don't know when I first heard about Eggs and Bacon, but I've been seeing their names etched into shelters, signs, and the like for some time now. There were rumors about their backstory, but the only thing I knew definitively was that it was a dad (Bacon, I think?) hiking with his young daughter (Eggs?). Also, I guess they had made some kind of apology after being caught tagging one of the shelters in the Smokies, though there was some speculation over whether their apology was heartfelt. The other thing I know about Eggs and Bacon is, they stopped at the alpaca farm on the same day that we did. Rabbit and I had really tried to eat our leftover pizza from yesterday, but it was time to part with the remains, and the cheese was only going to stay fresh for so long inside of my bear canister. So I asked Bacon if they'd be interested; he asked Eggs if she wanted pizza, she said "heck yeah", and our leftover pizza found a new home.

I also bought some alpaca socks for my mom for Mother's Day. It's pretty easy for all the days to kind of run into each other, but Mother's Day is at least one day I didn't want to forget. I'm going to try to send the socks home when I ship back my winter gear.

Virginia has been really pretty so far. I know I'm supposed to get tired of it eventually, but at least so far, it's a really pretty state. Also, those olive gardens? Turns out those were rhododendron bushes. (Hell, I didn't know.) And they've started blooming.

Today was another big milestone: we passed the quarter way mark! We took pictures next to a "1/4 GA>ME" sign. It's always exciting to pass another milestone, though it's hard to really make it mean anything.

One thing I didn't mention- Fluff hiked the 15 miles from the alpaca farm to the shelter with a full-size apple pie on his back. We stopped at Walmart for resupply, and packing out an apple pie just seemed like the right move. When we got to the shelter, I was excited about devouring it, but it turns out that more or less everyone I've ever met on trail was stopped at this shelter tonight. Dema (now Night Whisperer?), Forklift, Mosey, Brightside, Grave Digger, even Hitman were all here. It was nice to see familiar faces! We still devoured the apple pie, though.
