My watch told me to rest again. Boo.

I saw Snail Mail and her friends (fellow End-to-Ender Fire Magic, and Honeybuns) at Deer Park too -- it looks like we're all heading into Hot Springs tomorrow.Fire Magic lived up to her trail name by getting a fire started in the fire pit, while Honeybuns secured the kindling and I watched. Fire is likely the first thing that mankind ever invented, and it's still by far the most interesting one.

North Carolina privies were not built for people with normal dimensions. The only way to fit into this privy is to either cut off your knees (this seems suboptimal) or leaving the door slightly open. Also, the foundation didn't seem super stable? 1.5/5 stars.

Oh hey, I finished today at mile 272 -- that's exactly as far as the Long Trail, depending on the year. As of tomorrow, this will be the longest hike I've ever been on.
