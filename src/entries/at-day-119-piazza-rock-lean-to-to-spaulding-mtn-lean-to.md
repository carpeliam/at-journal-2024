We were a half mile out this morning before I realized we missed out on learning more about Piazza Rock. Ah well! I'm kind of missing the serendipitous "hike alone, camp together" vibe - I took my sweet time in a privy this morning (I guess I could have checked out the double privy last night?), and everybody waited for me, I felt a little shitty, pun intended.

Maine continues to deliver amazing vistas with spectacular water features. There's just lakes *everywhere*.

It's nice to be staying in shelters again. I was kind of paying attention to my tent-to-shelter ratio, and it went hard tent when I hit the no-see-ums and stayed that way through mosquito territory, but it seems like I'm far enough north where I can pick either way.
