Another day with Noah and Rabbit! And Noah is now named Fluff! We said goodbye to the ponies, seeing a few of them within 10 minutes of starting this morning. We started at just after 7am, which for me is actually really good, but I was still the last one ready.

I spent part of today trying to coordinate where to schedule a mail drop for my summer gear. According to the Internet, Pearisburg VA is more or less a good spot assuming you start with the bubble and hike at a normal speed, but I still need to figure out where best to send it. I tried texting a hostel in Pearisburg to see if they accept maildrops, and they do! So hopefully I'll have summer gear in a few days. In addition to having lighter sleep clothes and a lighter quilt, I'm also swapping out my bear canister for an ursack, given that I'm out of the areas of the trail (I think) that had [a rule about hoisting ursacks as if they were bear bags](https://appalachiantrail.org/trail-updates/georgia-to-virginia-food-storage-order-national-forest-land/). It was tricky to text back and forth, given it was raining and reception is what it is, but I was able to huddle underneath a trailhead sign, and Rabbit and Fluff hung out with me while I figured it out.

Today was a solid 20 miles. Fluff is feeling it, and is pretty sure he couldn't sustain this pace all the way until Maine, but it's cool to hang out while we can.
