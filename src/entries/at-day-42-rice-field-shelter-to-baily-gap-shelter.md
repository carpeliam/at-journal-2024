Always the last person out of camp. Technically there were some peeps in the shelter that looked like they were waiting for weather to improve, but other than that, I was the last one out. Eventually I caught up to Live Mas and Kachow around Pine Swamp Branch shelter where we chatted with a section hiker and I took a food break. I'm feeling a bit tired today.

Rabbit texted to say she's getting off trail due to a family emergency. Oh no! That sucks a lot. I've thought before that if my family had an emergency, that'd probably be the one kind of thing that would bring me off trail. I hope everything will be ok.
