Always the last person out of camp. Technically there were some peeps in the shelter that looked like they were waiting for weather to improve, but other than that, I was the last one out. Eventually I caught up to Live Mas and Kachow around Pine Swamp Branch shelter where we chatted with a section hiker and I took a food break. I'm feeling a bit tired today.

Rabbit texted to say she's getting off trail due to a family emergency. Oh no! That sucks a lot. I've thought before that if my family had an emergency, that'd probably be the one kind of thing that would bring me off trail. I hope everything will be ok.

I had planned initially to meet up with Patrick and Rachel in Harpers Ferry in early June, but that was before I had gotten on trail and had any idea what my pace might be. It looks like Patrick will be out until June 3rd, and Rachel will be out the first weekend of June. Gah, trying to plan logistics with only a cellphone on limited battery and 2 bars of LTE is really really hard.

I met 'Roid and his friend at the shelter tonight, they seem to be doing similar miles, I imagine I might see them again.
