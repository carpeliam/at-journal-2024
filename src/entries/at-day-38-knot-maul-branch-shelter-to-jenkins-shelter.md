I wasn't the last person out of camp this morning! I was second to last.

Rabbit, Fluff, and I initially agreed to meet up at Jenkins Shelter, instead of all hiking together. I think this probably works best for me, at least -- I feel like I can be more observant when I'm by myself. But Rabbit sent a text saying that she arrived at the shelter shortly after 1pm, and that she was going to push on. Rabbit's gotta rabbit, it was only a matter of time before she had to be free. And on the same day, I got a text from home saying my summer gear is arriving in Pearisburg on Monday, so it doesn't make sense for me to go fast and catch up. Oh well, it was pretty fun hiking with Rabbit and Fluff for a few days.

On the bright side, I did see some animals! I saw a bear cub running past me, and I almost stepped on a very full rattlesnake who happened to be sitting right on trail. Two animals in one day!

Also, Virginia continues to be pretty. I ran into Live Mas on top of Chestnub Knob as he was finishing up his lunch. Just gorgeous views.
