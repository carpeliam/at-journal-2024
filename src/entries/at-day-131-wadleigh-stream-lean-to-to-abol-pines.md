Today was just a beautiful day on trail. All the heavy lifting is done, aside from the last day. I got some views of Katahdin, but I had to take breaks to pay Shaw's (whoops, I really left in a hurry didn't I) and message Ted. Meeting up with him on the summit still feels like a loose plan but I think it'll work out!

The trail literally crossed a beach today. Oh Maine, you had me at hello, please stop.

We're at Abol Pines, officially out of the 100 mile wilderness. I bought way too many snacks. Bonk, DK and I were chatting about what ridiculous heavy thing we might pack out for our last night. DK is bringing a can of Chef Boyardee. We also got some trail magic from Judge's parents: a full-sized lobster roll. I had to split it with DK, I was so snack-laden.

Originally I was going to stay at Hurd, but I decided to press on as there seems to be a lot of people summiting and I wanted to make sure I get a spot at the Birches. So Bonk, DK, Smiley and I found a spot at Abol Pines -- some guy says that there might be some people up late partying, which kind of got me upset, but I'm going to follow others' lead and let it wash.

Sleep now, Ranger's station in the morning. Boo, it's raining... I just spent 2 days getting things dry. This too shall pass.
