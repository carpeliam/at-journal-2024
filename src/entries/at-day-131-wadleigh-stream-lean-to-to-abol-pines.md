Originally was going to stay at Hurd, but decided to press as there seems to be a lot of people summiting and I
wanted to make sure I get a spot at Birches.
Got some views of Katahdin, but had to take breaks to pay Shaw's and message Ted. Meeting up with him on
the summit still feels like a loose plan but I think it ll work out!

Sleep now, Ranger's station in the morning. Boo, it's rainingâ€¦ I just spent 2 days getting things dry. This too
shall pass.
