On my way out of Woods Hole, Hitman shouted out to me, "See you in 3 weeks!" There are a few people I'd definitely like to see again before this trip is out, and Hitman is on that list.

Live Mas and I half-walked, half-hitched into Pearisburg. The town isn't all that walkable, but we made it work. I was able to pick up my summer gear from the Post Office: fresh clothes! a lighter sleeping quilt! an ursack to replace my bear canister! Everything I wanted was in there. There wasn't really anywhere to change in the post office, so I went over to Food Lion to resupply then over to Dairy Queen to meet up with Brightside, Grave Digger, and Live Mas, grabbed some food, then headed back to the post office to ship my winter gear back home, along with my mom's socks.

Getting back to the trail, Live Mas and I hitched with this dude sporting a confederate flag front license plate and some pro-Trump stuff in the back seat. These are the kinds of people my Massachusetts friends and family might be nervous about, but I'm trying to keep an open mind about people on and around the trail, and he was nice enough to pick us up and give us a ride back, even if he was a bit of a weird dude.

Back on the trail, Live Mas and I hotstepped it up to Rice Field shelter. Pretty much everybody that didn't zero at Woods Hole is here, and there's another tramily too who fit a pretty typical tramily vibe. There was an interesting conversation where they thought we were all in denial as to our tramily-hood (a bunch of us are traveling loosely together but not calling ourselves a tramily), and we thought they're taking their tramily perhaps too seriously. I think they have an official tramily song? Or handshake? Or game they play on trail. They travel together exclusively. I don't know if I'd count myself part of a tramily at all, with only a loose association to the other people I've been with, but the contrast is kind of funny between the two groups.

There was a bit of fog as Live Mas and I got into Rice Field, but it's cleared up now, and it has really pretty views of the valley. It's just really nice out here.
