I saw a lot of trail runners this morning! It must be nice to have these mountains as your back yard, this would be a cool trail running spot. And Boiling Springs was really nice! At least it was nice to look at. And on the way in, I walked through some *really nice* farmland. The trail literally goes through the middle of the field! I didn't need to resupply, as I'll be in Duncannon tomorrow, but I did decide to replace my water filter as I was passing an outfitter in town. My water filter has been leaking on me, and I'm not sure if it's the filter itself, the collapsible bottle it's attached to, or the fact that the water bottle pocket is a little constricting, but I'll give a new filter a try and see what happens. I also grabbed some breakfast (technically multiple breakfasts) with a fancy coffee frappÃ© thing. With enough stops like this, I might just stop losing so much weight.

The walk after Boiling Springs was really gentle, too. I bought a gatorade from an 8-year-old tending a farm stand. Just a really nice day.
