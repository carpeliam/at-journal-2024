I'm wearing a Garmin watch during the trail, and one of its features is to recommend a workout every morning based on my current training load. On my first morning on the trail, it said ooh, yesterday was a lot, and you should rest, and I ignored this. On my second morning on the trail, it said it didn't know what the hell was going on but yesterday looked pretty tough, and I should rest. I didn't rest. On the third day, rinse and repeat. Every morning since my first day, my watch has told me to stop hiking, enough is enough. UNTIL TODAY. Today, my watch said, hey, today looks like a good day to go for a walk. Ok, it didn't phrase it like that, but we speak a language.

*I think my watch just told me I've got my trail legs.*

I left the Smokies this morning, stuffing the other half of my permit into a box just a mile into the day. Two miles later, I was picking up my mail drop from Standing Bear. Mosey was right, I don't think this would have been a spot to stay the night, but they were kind enough to let me hang out and charge electronics for a solid two hours.

Toward the end of the day, I crossed Max Patch, and holy crap, what amazing views. The sun was out, and so were all the locals, including a couple doing their engagement photos. I bet local wedding photographers make bank. You're not allowed to camp on Max Patch itself, and sadly, all the tent spots on the next hill over were all pretty full. It was 6:45pm when I rolled into Roaring Fork, and the shelter was full, but I snagged one of the last tent spots before heading back to the shelter's picnic table to make my dinner.

Someone asked me where I was from, and when I said "Boston", it turned out that there was another person in the shelter from Boston -- and from Jamaica Plain, no less! This was total deja vu for me, after the same thing happened to me on the Long Trail. It turns out that Snail Mail lives in the Forest Hills area, which is only 2 T stops away from me. Also, it turns out that one of Snail Mail's friends did the Long Trail the year before I did! And somehow remembers more of it than I did. I spent my whole dinner chatting about the LT, which at ~275 miles, is still the longest hike I've ever been on. But that might change any day now.
