Those whippoorwills last night really were not excited about me getting any sleep. And again, I was the last one out of camp this morning. Not like I had far to go - it was almost exactly 3 miles downhill from Deer Park Shelter to Hot Springs NC, and I took more or less the whole thing at a trot, trending toward canter. I've discovered that different knees prefer different trail directions; one of my knees has a harder time with going uphill while the other one has a harder time going down. But I've discovered that, if I land with my forefoot, going downhill gets a bit easier. So I've adopted this gait sometimes where one foot lands on the forefoot while the other lands on the heel. Human bodies are weird, human bodies walking all day every day are weirder. Whatever works, works.

I had booked my own personal room at the hostel, and checked in around 9:30am. After I put my stuff down, I looked on the map for the nearest coffee shop. But not just any shop that sells coffee. During one town stop on the Long Trail, I bought myself an affogato, and it was *delicious*. The milkfat is also probably important too. So now when I'm in town, I search for the coffee shop that's most likely to have an espresso machine, and hopefully some ice cream to go with it.

Hot Springs is a really lovely little trail town, with a main drag that runs for just a few blocks. Laughing Heart was at one end, and so I started out toward coffee, which I never drink while on the trail (it takes too much time and wastes a boil) but is a trail town staple for me. After walking just a block or so (the trail itself goes right down the main street!), I saw Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and Honeybuns walking toward me; they also had gotten their rooms settled, and were headed to the diner for breakfast. I planned to hit up the diner after, but I couldn't pass up breakfast company, so I asked if I could join them, and we headed over to the Smoky Mountain Diner. After we had finished our breakfast but were still chatting, some friends of Fire Magic's named Lost and Liberty came in and sat down with us. Lost was a tall and lanky Virginian, while Liberty resembled the me I'd aspire to in 10 years, albeit with a Scottish accent.

After breakfast was chore time. But first, fancy coffee. I walked the 0.3 miles to Artisun, and DID YOU KNOW THEY HAD A PIANO?! Holy crap. After accidentally finding a piano inside the Inn at the Long Trail, I had googled a few times about which hostels along the AT might have a piano, but came up dry. And here I was at a random coffee shop in North Carolina, and they had a piano. After getting my coffee, I asked the barista if I could borrow their piano, and they were happy to lend it. I spent a good chunk of time either playing old songs or just capturing the mood.

After a little while it was time to get some real chores done. I noticed this morning that my water bottle and filter was missing in action, so I looked into the Outfitter to see if they might carry the same one, but they didn't have the bottle in the same size, so I bought a pair of trail gaiters instead. (I'll always miss my Dirty Girl gaiters, and I'll never forgive Topo for making a proprietary gaiter system. But here I am, giving it a shot.) I grabbed some mediocre food options from a picked-over Dollar General, and headed back to Laughing Heart to get some laundry done. Their loaner clothes were infinitely more interesting than the oversized tees of the Inn at the Long Trail, and I pared a camoflage henley with a pair of purple capri pants that fit perfectly; "the bottoms for when I want to be seen, and the top for when I don't."

Going back to search for my water filter would add 6 miles to my day, which was a bummer, but I'd have to do it. But while I was chatting with someone at the hostel about having lost it, the hostel's caretaker overheard me and asked what kind it was - apparently, Numbers had seen my bottle along the trail and rescued it. The chances of someone else spotting it, deciding to pick it up, deciding to carry it north, and deciding to bring it to this hostel out of all places, must be pretty slim, but the trail does provide.

With time now left on the day, I headed back to Artisun to purchase a sugary excuse to sit down at the piano again. Honeybuns came in and saw me, and (unbeknownst to me in the moment) grabbed a video of me playing. Later that day, Honeybuns told me that there was a chapel at Laughing Heart that had a piano, so (almost immediately) I went to check it out. I noodled on one of the progressions I was playing with at Artisun, and a lyric came to me:

> This is who we are \
> In the fields, in the bars \
> In the streets, in the cars \
> In the roots, in the fire \
> And all that we need in the world is to see our reflection

On the Long Trail, I had an idea to create a musical project, "wind river highway", inspired by time on the trail, but nothing came of it. I think my problem was that the Long Trail was only 273 miles, and inspiration apparently doesn't come until mile 274.9.

I stayed up a bit late tonight, using the hostel wifi to join my normal Monday night hang out with friends "back home", and by back home I mean Georgia, DC, PA, NY... we usually chat from around 7pm to 8pm and then watch a movie together, and now even 8pm feels late for me. On one hand it was good to update them on how the trail has been, on the other it was nice just to fade into the background and be part of a conversation among old friends, even if I did have a harder time relating to the details of city life than I would have just a month ago or so.
