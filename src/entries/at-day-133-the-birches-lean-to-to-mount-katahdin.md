Of course I was the last one out of camp this morning. Of course I had to get up in the middle of the night to pee.

Katahdin is a beautiful mountain. I think this is maybe the third time I've hiked it, at least, but I've never done the Hunt trail. Every path up is a bit different, I guess. It started off fairly gently, and I got to say hello to some of the other hikers who were doing the hike with their families. Soon, it got into boulders, and I decided to take them as aggressively as possible. I cleared tree line shortly after, and

Oh my God. It's beautiful, and *fun*.

The steep part eventually gave way to flat, what I remember being called The Tablelands from other ascents but I might be conflating that with something else. I had to focus on keeping my feet dry through the Thoreau Spring section, but *it's happening*.

Soon, the summit came into view, and I could see some people I didn't recognize getting their photo by the sign, and *everything* just came back to me in a flood, I remembered everything, the Georgia sunrises, the late starts, *the trail provides!*, every memory all at once, and I started to heave and tear up, and then I got to the summit, and said hello to the people who had just finished taking their own photo. Their mood changed when I told them I had just finished the AT.

Ted arrived about 20 minutes after me, in typical Ted fashion! He asked the entire mountain if there was a Marathon Man present. It was so good to see him.

We made time to hike the Knife Edge and back, down the Abol trail, and now I'm done. I'm done, I hiked the AT.

I think I know how Alexander the Great must have felt as he wept, seeing as there were no more worlds to conquer. I'm still not sure how it feels to finish the AT; I'll have to let that process for a little bit before it feels real. Time to go home.
