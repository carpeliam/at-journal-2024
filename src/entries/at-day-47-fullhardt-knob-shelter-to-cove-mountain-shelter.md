I ended up leapfrogging with Gambit today, but mostly stayed in front of him just a bit. A good portion of the trail today loosely followed the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it was actually kind of nice. I remember reading that the colocation of this highway and the AT is one of the things that divided Benton MacKaye and Myron Avery. So far, at least, I can't see why Benton MacKaye was pissed.

After camp chores, Gambit suggested an "extracurricular" hike to me and the one other guy at camp to watch the sun go down from the view some 0.1 mile down the trail. I wish I had this idea more often. We just sat on the rocks and chilled as the sun went down, it was pretty good.
