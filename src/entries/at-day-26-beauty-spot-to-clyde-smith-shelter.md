Of course I was the last one out of camp this morning. Even though I was up at sunrise (spoiler: not quite as nice as the sunset, but not bad), I didn't get started on trail until 2 hours later.

Today was a balance of pretty scenery and feeling pretty weak. It was really pretty at the first summit, how the forest was spread out enough to let the light shine through, and I saw cool flowers, plants, and rock formations. But I felt kind of weak today, maybe just because of pack weight and heat. Maybe I need to learn to sleep better.

When I got to shelter, I saw that all the FarOut comments mentioned that someone here had norovirus last week, so everyone is tenting. That's fair.'

A number of the people tenting here know each other - there's a lot of people hiking that are part of an ex-military thing, I think to help them transition back into civilian life. We all ate dinner while sitting on a giant log to avoid sitting on any surfaces near the shelter.

On some of the trees by my tent site, I could literally see leaves growing out of the stems of the branch tips. I've never spent so much time with trees.
