I got a little turned around this morning and couldn't remember which way was north. I walked about a tenth of a mile in one direction before I ran into Chris, who I had met at the mayor's hiker feed back in Hiawassee. My doubt about which direction I was going in made him doubt which direction he was going in! He was right and I was wrong, so I'm glad I found out then before getting too far.

This morning's hike was really cool. Right after the shelter, the trail is on the ridgeline, but still mostly in the trees. And then, a switchback brings you out of the trees and gives you a view of the entire valley. It was an amazing view, up there with Franconia Ridge, and I'm bummed I didn't get a picture (there was someone behind me).

At the base of Wesser Bald is another milestone, the Nantahala Outdoor Center or NOC. As soon as I get there, I see Hitman, who I met the other day at the same shelter as Storm. I told him I came from Wesser Bald Shelter, and he says, "Oh, the norovirus shelter?" Apparently someone had thrown up in the shelter a few days before, and that makes the four of us who stayed there exposed. Great.

The NOC seems mostly like a tourist spot for white water rafters and the like, but I was able to eat a full breakfast, get some laundry done, print out my Smokies permit, and charge my electronics. Austin showed up, and we hung out a bit - he was meeting someone to buy a tent replacement for the tarp system he was using. We grabbed a late lunch, but then it was time for me to move on, as the next shelter was 7 miles away, all up hill. I've been going faster than Austin the last few days and I get the sense that he wants me to slow down a bit and stay at a similar pace, but he'll be off trail soon and I feel like I want to cover more ground. Technically there are some hotels or motels around here, but they cater to white water rafting tourists who are here to spend money, and that's not what I'm looking for.

While I was charging my electronics, I checked my email and saw that I had a letter from the Green Mountain Club - they were looking for potential panelists to help give a zoom info session about their experiences on the Long Trail. I had seen an email in March about it and even started filling out an application, but stopped when I tried answering the question of what I would bring to the panel; *"Dear GMC, I would bring to the table the unique perspective of a white dude from Massachusetts. Please include me in your panel!"* But today, the GMC reached out to me specifically, noting that I had indicated after finishing the trail that I'd be excited about sharing my experiences, and asked if I'd be interested in discussing it. I let them know that, yes I'm interested, but given that I'm out here on the AT, that could either be a really interesting perspective or a really gnarly scheduling exercise. I guess we'll see what happens.

I said a final goodbye as Austin's tent connection showed up. It was getting on 3:30pm at this point, and I was doing some quick calculations. Sunset's at 8pm, but tent spots fill up before then, and I'd have to beat 2 miles per hour just to make it before 7pm so that I wasn't eating dinner in the dark. Normally I've been getting 2.7 or 2.8 miles per hour but not uphill. I finished right around 6pm, so I think that put me around 2.7 miles per hour, going up hill! And I saw my first snake on trail: it was a black snake, and I think we both gave each other a good scare. As I pulled into the shelter, I saw there weren't many great tenting options, at least not this late, and I found a spot on the side of the hill that would do in a pinch.
