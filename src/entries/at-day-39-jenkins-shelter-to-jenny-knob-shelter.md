Today, I saw the less gorgeous side of Virginia, as I crossed the interstate via an overpass. I guess it's impressive that I'm able to walk for miles upon miles without crossing interstates more often, but it's definitely not very sexy.

I saw a sign that said "please, no deer carcasses." I can get behind that statement. I've also been seeing signs for shuttle buses to Trail Days, and people have been talking about it of course for quite a while. I think maybe half the hikers I've met are going and half aren't, and I'm definitely not going. I get little sleep as it is.

I crossed the 600 mile mark today! My shoes could have been retired 100 miles ago, but they're still going strong. They've got a little hole in them around where my Lone Peaks blew out (after only a week), but it's been so dry that the hole doesn't really bother me.

I guess I'm never too far away from hiking with someone I know -- I'm back again with Brightside, Grave Digger, Live Mas, Forklift, and Mosey. And I finally met the other Liam from Boston! "Kachow" has been hanging out with these guys, and he's from the south shore (Hingham I think?), which is close enough to Boston. Brightside extended an invite to Woods Hole hostel tomorrow, so I think I'll tag along.
