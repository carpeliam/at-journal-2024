Another long water carry! Stopped early at the Gateway Hotel to grab water and borrow the bathroom. After reading the FarOut comments a little more carefully, I guess I was supposed to message him in advance - I'm afraid I woke him up. When departing, though, he handed me a meditation pamphlet, I guess he gives that out to everyone. Over all, a nice guy making his way in the world, though the hotel was in various states of disrepair and I refilled my water directly from his kitchen tap.

Right after I crossed the street after leaving the hotel, there was a water cache at the base of Wind Gap parking lot. Maybe I didn't need to stop at the hotel after all, but it was good to make the human connection. I stopped again for water at the next shelter which had it flowing from the faucet, and chatted with some day hikers there.

Delaware Water Gap seems like a neat spot! Seems on the touristy end. Shops stay open on the weekends and then close down in the middle of the week when the tourists aren't around. Unfortunately, the coffee house that No Plan suggested is closed until after I leave tomorrow, so there won't be any chance at an affogato for me.

I ran into Freedom at the hostel, who told me about a $2 shuttle to Walmart. They had kind of funky rules (I couldn't get on the shuttle for any amount of money if I didn't reserve it ahead of time, even if I was going to the same place and there was plenty of room), but I lucked out in getting a pretty quick shuttle both there and back. Another Ben & Jerry's pint for me!
