Another long water carry! Stopped early at the Gateway Hotel to grab water and borrow the bathroom. Skipped
the water cache at the base of Wind Gap parking lot. Got water from the faucet at the shelter, and chatted with
some day hikers there. Saw Freedom at the hostel, who told me about $2 shuttle to Walmart.
