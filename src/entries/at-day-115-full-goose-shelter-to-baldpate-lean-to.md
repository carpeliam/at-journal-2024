I made it through Mahoosuc Notch! And up Mahoosuc Arm. The notch, which is only a mile long, took me about an hour and 45 minutes. I definitely didn't speedrun it; it was a big jungle gym, and I took my time and savored it. I was a little nervous about Songbird and Ovenbird, though. I told them this morning that I was aiming for Baldpate Lean-to and hoped I might see them there -- Songbird said she wasn't sure how far they'd get, and they might just aim for Bethel. I can't imagine it'd be that easy to carry a guitalele through here, but they've managed to get it to Maine in the first place, so they probably know what they're doing.

The arm was a fun ascent -- I've heard it's really challenging for southbounders, maybe similar to how it felt to descent Moosilauke for me. The ascent though felt like a slightly less difficult Wildcat.

Shortly after the Arm was Speck Pond, which was really pretty. There's an AMC shelter there, the last one of the trail, but I kept going. A little while later in the afternoon, I could hear someone coming up behind me, so I pulled off to the side, only to see that it was Bonk, of all people. I don't think I've seen Bonk and DK since... Warwick, maybe? It's been a hot minute. We all ended up at Baldpate Lean-to. There were some nice older local guys staying in the shelter, and I chatted them up. It feels maybe common now to spot more southbounders and locals than northbounders, and it's kind of refreshing.
