I felt pretty tired and weak today. I definitely didn't sleep super well last night (surprise surprise), and the descent down Garfield was hair raising. Kind of like the descent down Moosilauke the other day, except maybe a bit less steep, and instead of being next to a waterfall, the trail itself was practically a waterfall, which required a lot of caution. Which would have been no problem if I had gotten enough sleep last night, but ah well.

I left this morning thinking that I might need to do big miles, because the itineraries I'm looking at seem a bit confusing. All of the itineraries I've been looking at had me stopping at Garfield last night and Ethan Pond tonight, but the 18 mile plan has me hiking 20 miles from Gorham to Gorham a few days out, and that makes 0 sense. I think it might be a misprint? so I thought it might make sense for me to try to get to Mitzpah Hut tonight. But I did the calculations in my head: that'd be ~24 miles, or 12 hours at 2 miles per hour.

I passed a few people who had stealth camped after Garfield, including Beat Box; I told him as I walked by that I was gonna hike 24 miles today, and he gave me some encouragement, but I realized within a few hours that it wasn't going to happen. It didn't happen.

Abandoning the Mitzpah plan enabled me to stop at huts along the way, so it's good that I realized relatively quickly that Mitzpah wouldn't happen. I grabbed some breakfast and baked goods at Galehead hut, and then stopped again at the Zealand Falls hut.

Last year, a week or so after I finished the LT, I went on a hike with Meg to scope out some stealth camp spots she was curious about. The hike was along the AT, and pretty flat, and I remember thinking that maybe the NH section of the AT might not be so bad. That hike was basically the section of trail between Zealand Falls and Ethan Pond, and as it turns out, *it's the only section of flat trail in NH I've come across*. It was nice though to hike through this section again, and relive the memory of familiar trail.

I pulled into camp around 3:30pm and got my camp chores out of the way. I chilled out by the pond (I'm listening to the audiobook for *The Comfort Crisis*, as recommended by Rabbit), and the AMC campsites are earning their $5 without a doubt. It's still super early, but I'm going to turn in, and see if I can claw back some of the sleep I've been missing out on.
