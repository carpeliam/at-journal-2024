I'm on the list! It'll be me, Bonk, DK, Chattaa, Judge, Gremlin, Smiley, MacGyver, Sweaty Beattie, and Lady Slipper. Out of all of those people, MacGyver and Sweaty Beattie are the only two I met in the 100 mile wilderness; I met Lady Slipper around the beginning of Maine, Smiley in NH, Chattaa and crew at the ice cream challenge, and I think I met Bonk and DK in PA, or at least somewhere close to a Wawa.

We had pretty much all day to walk the 10 miles to the Birches, so we chilled out for a bit at Abol Bridge again. I'm glad I didn't stay at Hurd last night - I saw a group of three hikers chilling at Abol Bridge who said they were just shy of getting a spot in the Birches, and they were having a hard time finding another spot elsewhere. That was almost me.

The walk through Baxter was the most relaxing walk of the trail. It's as if every bird was chirping, "relax, you did it. You got this." On other days of the trail, Katahdin felt like the final boss, but today - dare I say it - it feels like a victory lap, the cherry on top, the prize, the pot of gold at the end of a long rainbow. We all had lunch at a library of sorts in the park, and I watched Judge take a canoe out on the pond, with Katahdin as the backdrop.

I got to the Birches a little after 3pm and set up my tent for the last time. Had my last meal. All I have left in my pack is snacks for tomorrow. I think most other people are slack packing, but Snitches and every other piece of kit is coming with me. They're not going to miss this.
