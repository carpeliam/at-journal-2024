I had made up my mind to hike the entirety of the Roller Coaster in one day, which might be stupid because I camped last night almost 10 miles before it started. So today marks my longest day on trail so far, but also maybe my earliest start without being spurred on by someone else.

I did it, it was good. I passed the 1000 mile mark, and left a "1002" mile marker for Rabbit and Fluff, should they ever find it, commemorating 2x the 501 marker we left way back when. I'm so tired. Time for sleep.

I sat down to dinner next to Freedom, a German guy, and we chatted for a little bit. When I sat down exhausted, I think he almost immediately took me for someone obsessed with miles at the expense of smelling the roses. I don't even know anymore where I am on this spectrum, but this is the longest day I've ever hiked so I don't know if this makes a pattern.

I've hiked 1000 miles now. I finally finished Virginia. I'm less than 10 miles away from Harpers Ferry. I did all the things today. Hence the sleeping.
