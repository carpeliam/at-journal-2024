If it has to rain (and it does), it's good to happen on a town day. Franklin has a shuttle system just like Hiawassee, and picks up at both Rock Gap and Winding Stair Gap, which is 3 or 4 miles further down the trail. Winding Stair would be the ideal spot given that it would put us back on trail with fewer miles to walk, but we weren't sure if we could make it there before the 9:30am shuttle, so sure enough I found some of my shelter mates huddled under a tree at Rock Gap. I came up singing "Singing in the Rain", just enjoying the weather. As the shuttle pulled up, we waited for people to get off first before we got on; I guess the stairs were super slippery, as someone almost completely wiped out. In Franklin, I snagged some more food from Ingles (this one a slightly smaller and more limited than the Hiawassee location, but they did have Southern Butter Pecan flavored Talenti), and then treated myself to some large frappuccino-like monstrosity at Brooklyn Bagels. While I was inside, the sky opened up and it rained hard, but then stopped again just when it was time to leave. I don't think I understand southern weather patterns just yet. I brought my sandwich and frappe back to the gazebo and found a place to charge my phone, having an early lunch with some of other hikers I met on the sidewalk today.

My original plan was to enjoy town, maybe hang out with some of the peeps from the shelter last night, but after a few hours passed and I had already accomplished my town chores (food to pack out, food to wolf down), I decided to jump on the 12pm shuttle back to Rock Gap. Kind of a bummer, because around an hour later, I finally got a text from Dying about meeting up at 5:30pm.

As I was getting off the shuttle, I saw that guy from Standing Indian who had made such a fuss about bear safety. (Austin told me later that, while he spent a good 40 minutes looking for a good branch to hang his food, Fussbucket--not a real trail name--hung his from the weakest branch just a few feet off the ground.) I was so fixed on making eye contact with him that I missed my footing and slipped down the shuttle stairs in the same way that this morning's hikers had. "Careful," said Fussbucket in a manner that in no way communicated any concern for my safety, and I picked myself up and walked past him, back to the trail. Not 5 minutes later, after the shuttle departed with Fussbucket on his way into town, his friend (the kind one of the two) showed up, out of breath, wondering if I had seen his friend. I had to inform him that he had just left a few minutes before - turns out that this guy busted his butt to make the shuttle, and Fussbucket couldn't be bothered to wait 5 minutes. And technically, this guy was on time, as the shuttle left some 3 minutes early. Poor guy.

Speaking of Austin. This morning was maybe the last time I'll see him, and I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye. He's an ex-Marine whose wife died of breast cancer just a short while before he came out on the trail- it was kind of the forcing factor for him to come out here at all. He had already booked an Alaskan cruise some time later this summer with his dad, so I'm not sure if I'll see him again. He continued on this morning to meet his dad at Winding Stair Gap, and now he could be anywhere.

The weather continued to hedge between being rainy and stormy, until finally it decided to really storm. The wind was whipping at my shell, and I just focused on keeping my head down and moving forward. Whereas last night's shelter was large and sturdy, tonight's shelter was packed like sardines. Storm volunteered for everyone to make space for me, but I could tell I wasn't going to fit and so I waited for a break in the rain to set up my tent. And now I'm writing this while it's thundering and lightning-ing; I thought this spot might be well protected from the wind, but my little tent is still getting hammered. This is definitely the first "Type 2 fun" day. Sometimes I can't believe I'm actually out here on the trail - I'm maybe a bit worried that it won't sink in until I'm done. I write this with only a thin layer of dyneema protecting me from a thunderstorm. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.


I noticed today that the trail in these parts is cut into the side of the incline. This is maybe an act of kindness,
so you don't have to go over the top of the hill directly, but it feels unnatural- I remember "On Trails" which
talks about the evolution of trails where iterations find easier, more straightforward paths. This on the other
hand feels very intentional, which it is. Is intentional the same thing as unnatural? Maybe not, but it feels more
akin to the product of western thinking than to my ancient forefathers.
