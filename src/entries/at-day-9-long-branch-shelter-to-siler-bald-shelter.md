Today was maybe the last day I ll see Austin, and I didn t even have a chance to say goodbye. Austin is an exMarine whose wife died of breast cancer right before he came out on the trail- it was kind of the forcing factor
to get him out on the trail. He s off to go on an Alaskan cruise with his dad before coming back on the trail, so
I m not sure if I ll see him again. I went into town via Rock Gap shuttle, but he went on to meet his dad at
Winding Stair Gap.
Today was also my first thunderstorm. I crunched miles for the last day or so, ahead of the 15 mile AT Guide
plan, to make sure I didn t go over Albert Mtn with its fire tower during a thunderstorm. Now I m writing this
while it s thundering and lightning-ing outside Siler Bald Shelter, which I thought might be well protected from
wind but my little tent is still getting hammered. Definitely the first type 2 fun day. Sometimes I can t believe I m
actually out here on the trail. I m maybe a bit worried that it won t sink in until I m done.
I noticed today that the trail in these parts is cut into the side of the incline. This is maybe an act of kindness,
so you don t have to go over the top of the hill directly, but it feels unnatural- I remember ‚ÄúOn Trails‚Äù which
talks about the evolution of trails where iterations find easier, more straightforward paths. This on the other
hand feels very intentional, which it is. Is intentional the same thing as unnatural? Maybe not, but it feels more
akin to the product of western thinking than to my ancient forefathers. I write this with only a thin layer of
dyneema protecting me from a thunderstorm. There s no putting the genie back in the bottle.
