Ugh. Sometimes a day can be so good and so bad. It was really a beautiful walk into Harpers Ferry this morning. I remember Rabbit saying that ferns were her favorite plant, and hiking into Harpers Ferry surrounded by ferns on all sides, I can see why.

When I got to town, I stopped by the ATC headquarters, got my photo taken, got my photo taken again when I realized other people had gotten their photos while wearing their packs and I didn't want my pack (which had supported me all this way) to feel left out, and returned to the trail, walking through town toward the edge where I might continue on. This felt like the spot I might return to tomorrow morning, and that would have been the case if two things didn't go dramatically wrong: (1) my shoes weren't actually waiting for me at the post office, and (2) there weren't any open beds in town this evening.

I was kind of nervous about the shoes when I realized that REI had shipped them via UPS without really asking me. I wasn't sure if a UPS package could be picked up from USPS, but the Internet wasn't super conclusive. I was hopeful when the delivery status said that they had been successfully delivered to the loading dock and signed off on by someone named Ricky, but the people at the post office said they didn't know anyone named Ricky who worked there. I looked out by the loading dock anyway, just to see if maybe the shoes had escaped notice, but wherever my shoes had been left 3 days ago, they weren't here now.

I guess I'll be walking some more miles on this same pair of shoes, which have carried me over 1000 miles and have a few holes in them.

Also, I initially pictured Harpers Ferry as a quaint little town, darling halfway point of the Appalachian Trail. Now that I'm here on the first Saturday in June, I'm finding it to be a claustrophobic slice of American history tourism where all the beds have been taken by tourists interested in American history. I've looked at some of the historical monuments but I still have no idea what history the town is famous for, other than being old.

I stopped for a brownie sundae to try to raise my spirits, and the woman almost finished taking my order before she remembered that they're out of brownies. Fuck this place.

I ended up walking a few miles out to get to a nearby hostel, but I misread some FarOut comments about crossing the tracks on the way to the hostel, and walked a few miles past the hostel only to have to walk back on the other side of the tracks. It was actually mostly a nice walk along the Potomac on a nice bike path, but there would be no saving this day.
