Last night was another late night peeing fiasco. I woke up with a dire need to pee, but I'd have to walk past around 4 tents to get to the privy, so I tried to walk without turning on my headlamp, but peeing in the middle of the night is also an audible activity. Before long, the woman from the next zone over had turned on her headlamp, as she was probably even *more* concerned about strange noises that weren't accompanied by a light in the distance. I had no choice but to turn on my headlamp and walk to the privy. Ugh.

Today was a good day! Good weather, pretty views. At one point in the morning I heard a lot of really loud cars in the distance, and I thought some local car enthusiasts were tearing up some local roads and I might have a hard time crossing the street - turns out, it was a local race track and I was able to get a good view of them from the hill. I stopped at the Mountainside Cafe for brunch with Bandit and Bluegrass, where (!!!) they were able to make me an affogato, even when it wasn't on the menu. Hallelujah.

Returning to the subject of peeing, when I passed a sign for the 1500 mile mark, I felt compelled to pee next to it, but then I saw some day hikers not far from me, so I hustled on. But shortly thereafter, when I was safe, there was a milestone made of sticks, so I peed in the woods not far from there. With any luck, I'll be fully feral by the time I finish the trail.

Tonight's shelter was a steep 0.3 mile drop, which ordinarily would be cause for angst, but the FarOut comments give unanimous praise for the water here, so I'm all for it. I decided to stay in the shelter, (a) because I think I might be out of no-see-um territory, and (b) because I don't really want to mess with the tent platforms. There are some mosquitos here, but hopefully the rain keeps them away.
