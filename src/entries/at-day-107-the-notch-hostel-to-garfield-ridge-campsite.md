SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY. I've told a bunch of people that, if there's one spot you want to hit on a nice day, it's Franconia Ridge, and *I DID IT*. Thank you, oh wonderful south-bounder who blessed me with good weather throughout the Whites!

I started off today in a bit of an over-emotional mess; I just have too many emotions and not enough sleep to manage them all. But I took my time today, and enjoyed every moment. I asked Red Maple to take a photo of me on the ridge, half profile, so that I get a photo of Snitches sitting on top of my pack. In my mind, it's Snitches that's carrying me down the trail, not the other way around.

I had a really fortuitous moment of trail provision today on the ridge: Hawkeye (the son in the father/son duo) picked up my tent footprint after I had apparently dislodged it from my pack while putting on a layer. That kid is alright. I don't want to think about what might have happened if I lost it, and the chances would have been high considering how windy it is on the ridge.

I'm glad I took the time in Vermont to try my hand at setting up my tent on a platform. Garfield Ridge campsite is more or less all tent platforms, and I had to share one with 3 other tents. It was nice to already have at least some picture as to how to set up on it. The X-Mid does take up a lot of space, though; I'm really glad I didn't get a 2-person, it would have been a pain in the ass.

The AMC apparently has a thru-hiker program where you can get discounts on hut food for staying at the campsites. I'm a sucker for all things food, so I'm in. I had to pay $10 to stay at the campsite (which is already less than the $15 for day hikers), but it'll be $5 for other campsites along the way. Nice!

By the start of the blue blaze to the campsite, there's a small set of stairs up a boulder that leads to a bench sitting at an overlook. It was crowded when I arrived, but I had it to myself for a little bit toward sunset. It's just so peaceful here. I'm glad I didn't try to press on to another campsite; this site is doing good things for my brain.
