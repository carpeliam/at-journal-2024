I finished all of today's miles by 11:15am or so, in plenty of time for the noon shuttle to Shaw's! I've booked TWO nights in a bunk. I'm so stoked for my second zero. I definitely need it.

Tonight's a Monday, and there's a VHS player at the hostel with a good selection of movies. I convinced everybody in the hostel to watch a Bad Batch movie with me, and I convinced the Batch to watch a movie the hostel had a copy of, though Jurassic Park is an easy sell. I didn't get to bed until after 10pm, but it was worth it, and tomorrow's zero should hopefully smooth out any tiredness.
