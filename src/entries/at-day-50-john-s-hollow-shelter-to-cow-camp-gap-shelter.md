Last night, some guy came into the shelter after dark with his light turned on, having just hiked a marathon. Shortly thereafter, he asked if we had any bug spray. I was kind of annoyed (first off, no I don't carry bug spray, second, shouldn't you have your own bug solution? third, it's after bedtime and everybody's clearly trying to sleep), and just said no, sorry. A few minutes later, his headlamp is back on, and he decides the bugs are too much, and he leaves to set up his tent. And that's when I noticed the bugs too. Honestly, after the fact, I'm guessing the bugs would have kept me up even if this guy hadn't. I guess these are the No-See-Ums I've heard about? They kept Gambit up, too.

When I was figuring out what to bring out on the trail, I decided not to bring any bug spray or bug net or anything. Mosquitos and gnats at home never bother me, especially if there are other people around. But I think that maybe the fact that I'm not used to No-See-Ums is partly why I wasn't prepared. They were brutal.

Gambit and I had an early lunch at Punchbowl Shelter, surrounded by bullfrogs at the pond. A few hours later, I passed the 800 mile mark! This milestone was marked with actual stones. We finished the day at Cow Camp Gap Shelter, which was annoyingly far away from the trail. Initially we thought we both might chance another night in the shelter, as it was threatening to rain - but when a short hard rain came and went, we decided it was better to set up tents now than wait until we were half asleep and getting eaten alive like last night.
