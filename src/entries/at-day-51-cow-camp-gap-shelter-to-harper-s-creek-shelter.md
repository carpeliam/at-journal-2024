Today I passed The Priest Shelter - their log book invites you to confess your trail sins, like not digging a cat hole or skipping an unsavory part of the trail. I had no confession but wrote an entry anyway to praise the privy, which was top notch. The hike in and out of The Priest was one of the steeper recent hikes, but didn't feel too bad - if anything, it felt good to get a slog in.
