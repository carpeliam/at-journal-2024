Today started off really hard. Last night's sleep was terrible. My knees and ankles are letting me know that they're not happy about everything. I took a pee break at a view some 30 minutes into the day, and I don't know if I ever recovered.

About 6.5 miles into the day, at Stecoah Gap, I arrived at a highway crossing, and there was another thru hiker chilling out, sitting at a picnic table and chatting on the phone. As I pulled up to a corner of the table and started in on a snack, a stranger walked up to me with a snack packet and offered it up as trail magic. Score! Yes sir, I'll take some raisins, please and thank you.

 I grabbed some lunch at Brown Fork shelter, and met Midnight Snack. He seemed to have pains of his own, but his disposition about it was something to aspire to. Hopefully I see more of him, but I'm afraid I won't - I might finish this whole thing without establishing much of a tramily. When I went to the privy, I realized I had forgotten my poop kit back at the shelter, and I was too tired to walk back and fetch it, so I used leaves instead. I think they did the job.
