My knees and ankles are letting me know, they re not happy about everything
Today started off really hard, good to know it was hard for others
Met Midnight Snack and Twelve, hopefully I see more of them, but I m afraid I won t see either soon- I might
finish the whole thing without establishing much of a tramily
ðŸ’© at Brown Fork Gap shelter- got to the privy and realized I didn t have my poop kit, was too tired to go back
and get it so I used leaves instead. I think they did the job.

Sleep score: 55
