Today started off really hard. Last night's sleep was terrible. My knees and ankles are letting me know that they're not happy about everything.

I grabbed some lunch at Brown Fork shelter, and met Midnight Snack. He seemed to have pains of his own, but his disposition about it was something to aspire to. Hopefully I see more of him, but I'm afraid I won't - I might finish this whole thing without establishing much of a tramily. When I went to the privy, I realized I had forgotten my poop kit back at the shelter, and I was too tired to walk back and fetch it, so I used leaves instead. I think they did the job.
