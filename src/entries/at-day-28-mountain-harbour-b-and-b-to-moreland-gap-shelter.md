Two things about Mountain Harbour. Number one, that might be the best breakfast of my life. Unsure. Number two, the tenting area was pretty close to the highway. Maybe slept better than when above the guy with sleep apnea? Unsure.

I passed another milestone today - 400 miles! This time, the milestone was spelled out with sticks instead of stones. And the first few miles of Tennessee don't disappoint: I walked for a few miles today by a beautiful babbling brook that could have come from *A River Runs Through It*.

I've had this logistics challenge that I've been trying to figure out: the GMC End-to-Ender panel is coming up on Friday, and there's a dry run for it tomorrow. I'll need to find a hostel with wifi tomorrow, and either zero for a few days, or keep on hiking and find another hostel for Friday. Ideally, it'd be nice to do the real thing in Damascus, given that it's the home of the Trail Days festival (as much as I don't care about Trail Days), but that seemed like a stretch mileage-wise. I mentioned this to Noah, and he told me about the Damascus Marathon, which is when you hike the 26.2 miles from Iron Mountain Shelter to the *Marathon Gas Station* in Damascus. That would be epic, and I think it just might work.

While we were eating dinner at the picnic table, an intrepid little mouse just walked right out into the daylight. Brave little sucker, though I guess this is more his home than mine, as he'll still be here tomorrow.
