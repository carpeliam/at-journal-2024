My life was improved this morning by a visit to a cafe. They had an affogato right on the menu (!), though it was a creemee, which was a bit weird.

I hiked on and off with Kachow, Live Mas, Brightside, and Grave Digger, but we got spread out at times and there were a few times where they did a bit of opportunistic yellow blazing.

I really like something I did song-wise! I've been bouncing back and forth on this Robert Frost / "Mending Wall" idea, "something there is that doesn't love a wall" etc, and I think I have a chorus for it. This kind of "Gorbachev, tear down this wall" idea, where maybe the things that unite us are stronger than the things that divide us: "maybe we belong on the same side / good fences don't exist inside or outside the mind". I sat down and recorded me humming it a bit while taking a break to refill water. It's probably a weird combination of lack of sleep as well as being overwhelmed with completeness of an idea coming/fitting together, but I was tearing up a bit as I was going through it. Walking by/through stone walls during the course of the day just kind of reinforced the idea. I hope I like it as much later as I do now.

We finished off the day at Happy Hill Shelter. There's a trio that came in after us: Chappy, Red Maple, and Hawaii. They ended up chatting with Live Mas for a while, and I ended up gifting Chappy a Starbucks Via packet that's probably been in my pack since Georgia. Tomorrow, we'll all cross into NH, and I'll say goodbye to Vermont again.
