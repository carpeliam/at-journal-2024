Last night was super windy. I really do need to get better at putting my tent up: there was so much slack that each gust was pushing the tent wall into my face. I didn't sleep super well, my watch gave me a sleep score of 50/100. To be fair, it hasn't given a dramatically higher score to any of the other previous nights, but I've got a lot of adrenaline. I'm going to have to learn how to chill out.

Another milestone today: my first trail magic! Technically, I was offered trail magic on my first day, but it felt weird being offered a candy bar on my first day out, so I declined. Today however, I rolled up to Hogpen Gap, and there after the road crossing was a super nice dude with a pop-up canopy, a wide selection of snacks, a charging station for electronics, a good number of chairs, a hand washing station, and--the grand finale--homemade veggie stew. This was not this dude's first rodeo. I took some stew (he did all the serving, following proper norovirus protocols), as well as a kiwi, a brownie, and a mini-cinnamon bun. And then I pushed on.

At camp tonight at Low Gap Shelter, I met Sink, as well as Tom, a stout 50+ guy from Connecticut. Tom was the first New Englander I've met on trail, and we chatted about the Whites. I told him I had read in the AT Guide about a hiker feed in Hiawassee with the mayor on Mondays, and we planned to lay up at Unicoi Gap (~10 miles up) tomorrow and head into Hiawassee the next day.
