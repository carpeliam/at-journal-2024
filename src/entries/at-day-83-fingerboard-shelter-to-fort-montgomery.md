I wasted so much time today trying to chase an outhouse, just to avoid digging a cat hole. A lot of NY shelters don't have privies, but because there's a lot of state park land, it looks like they concentrate the bathrooms near day hiker spots. So I hiked off-trail to one of the day hiker spots, but their bathroom was out. I kind of pleaded with them to let me use it anyway (I ran out of shame somewhere outside of Duncannon) but the best they could do was to point me to another outhouse further up the road. In the middle of my frustration, Live Mas showed up at the state park - looks like they're doing big road miles today.

The backup bathroom was a lot further off trail and was really just a portapotty in an overflow parking lot. Actually, there were two portapotties, one that was out of order and another that had no toilet paper, but I tore off some toilet paper from the out-of-order portapotty and carried it over. Afterwards, I chatted with some locals who are apparently using the area as a music practice spot. By the end of it, we had shared some stories, and I was able to yogi some snacks and water.

Before getting on the trail, I had heard of yogiing, where you use jedi mind tricks to get day hikers to part ways with the snacks or rides that they didn't plan to offer initially, but are still willing to give. I never imagined I'd develop the skill, but here I am.

I passed the 1400 mile mark. After the halfway point and its artistic mix of rocks and sticks, I was hoping that successive milestones would get more and more extravagant, but we're back to just rocks now. I went over Bear Mountain, the spot where I had initially planned to meet Teresa and Carter, and it was basically a bunch of stairs. *"Bear Mountain? More like Stair Mountain, amirite?"* I said to myself. There was a weird detour in the trail that seemed to route away from all water sources, except for an off-trail water spigot that I skipped, in a questionable decision to not sidetrack too much. But it's still pretty hot out. On top of Bear Mountain, they had these super expensive vending machines, and I paid like $8 for a powerade and an ice cream sandwich.

After the mountain itself was the Bear Mountain Zoo, the lowest elevation of the entire trail. I thought I was so late they might not let me in, but I squeaked by! The zoo is populated largely by injured animals, which seems really cool but also means that the animals aren't terribly active in their enclosures. I stopped by the bear enclosure, and very true to my AT experience, there weren't any bears there. I'm probably going to go through this entire trail and only see a single bear cub.

I had arranged to stay at a local motel for the night, as apparently there's a guy who's really good at washing socks, which is something I desperately need, ever since trying to wash them myself. He picks me up from the parking lot just outside of the zoo, and he seems nice, but as we're pulling out, he sees a Hasidic Jew and makes an angry comment about how they're running the world not paying their taxes. I was so incredibly uncomfortable, and I'm upset with myself for not just getting out of the car. As we kept driving, his conversation shifted to talking about some of the severe flooding that happened in New York last year, apparently by the same storm system that wrecked a good portion of Vermont. He talked about a bridge being washed out and a girl drowning. As he was talking through it, he was narrating his own need to find a target to blame, some cause for why bad things happen to good people. The only potential cause he could put words to was the Chinese, saying that the timing wasn't too far off from the weather balloon incident. The dude is definitely a bit unhinged, but the more he talked, the more I just felt sorry for him. It must be really tough to need that external "reasons" for things just to make it through the day.

The FarOut comments were right about the socks. He prewashed my socks in a hot water/vinegar solution. They might not feel exactly brand new again, but they're certainly much better off.
