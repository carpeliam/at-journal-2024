Today just felt *slow*. I tried to take my time by going down all the blue blaze trails, all the side quests. Annapolis Rock! Black Rock Cliffs! Beautiful views from a horribly defaced High Rock Ledges! A boulder field which is surely a sign that Pennsylvania is near! And finally, Pen Mar Park!

This was a good stop. I ordered a pizza and a coke, and sat on a bench eating it while I recharged my power bank. And when it was time to move again, I hiked another 0.2 miles to cross the Mason-Dixon Line and another state border into Pennsylvania.

Good bye, Maryland. I was already frustrated when I entered you, and it wasn't your fault; you've had some nice stretches with some interesting monuments, but you also put a trail right next to somebody's house and under flyover country. My stay was short, but I wouldn't have wanted it to be any longer.
