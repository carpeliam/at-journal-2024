Once again, I had good luck getting a hitch into town, just by asking for one. There was a couple in the parking lot about to leave, and while they weren't headed into Manchester Center, they were willing to drop me off given how close it was.

I got two things squared away at the outfitter's: I exchanged my favorite pair of socks (the same socks I had bought from the same outfitter last year on the LT) for a brand new pair of Darn Toughs, and I got a replacement tip for my trekking pole. They even attached it for me, which looks like it might have been a bit tricky to do. I'm going to miss that pair of socks, but I'm not going to miss having holes in the bottom of them.

I grabbed breakfast alongside a section hiker at Up For Breakfast (maybe named because it's on the 2nd floor?). He asked the waitress if they carried Vermont maple syrup, and she replied it's the only syrup they have. Of course it is. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I mostly hung out at the same places I enjoyed last year, including the same cafe (no affogato, sadly), but eventually it was time to get back on the trail. I got a relatively easy hitch back, and proceeded to attack Bromley. I checked out the lookout tower (which I think is new? it was definitely too foggy last year for sure to see anything), and, of course, ran into Live Mas. We hiked together for a while over the next two peaks until Live Mas had to take care of something and I kept going. I think they're planning on heading to Lost Pond Shelter tonight. Originally, I had crazy ideas of making it as far as Little Rock Pond or maybe just Big Branch, but I don't think I have it in me. I ended up stopping at Griffith Lake, mostly because it's supposed to be a really pretty spot but also because they have tenting platforms, and I want to experiment with the fishbone tent anchors my mom brought for me.

Update: this would have been a great spot were it not for the mosquitos. Still nice, though.
