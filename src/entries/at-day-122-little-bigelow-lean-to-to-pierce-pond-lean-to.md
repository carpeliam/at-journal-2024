Today was another pretty but very long day. A lot of the miles today were a slog, kind of like northern PA but instead of rocks, it was mud, and rocks, and logs, and the like. I took a nice little break and let my feet hang off the dock at West Carry Pond. It was nice, but I could have spent a full day there and still have room left to recharge.

I got to camp right around 3pm. There's some kind of French-Canadian girl scout troupe (or something akin), they're set up behind the shelter up on the hill. Tomorrow, a number of us are grabbing a pancake breakfast at a local camp. We went this afternoon to reserve a spot. The guy is really friendly, and I've decided to just ignore the huge Trump 2024 banner hanging by his door.
