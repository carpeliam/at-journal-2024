Last night I ended up at the same shelter as a guy named Guinness, who I think I also saw briefly at the last trail magic spot. We caught up with each other this morning at some trail magic at a park about 2 miles in, as well as a guy named Mad Hermit who had passed by this morning while I was still taking down my tent. They caught up again when I was getting water at the next shelter, and again when I was chasing down blue blazes for views (spoiler: views aren't so great when it's cloudy). They're both headed to a hostel tonight that does free dinners on Wednesdays, and Guinness convinced me to come too. It seems like a pretty good deal: $12 to tent, free dinner, score!

The hostel is really a church that offers hostel services, and the dinner is an act of evangelism. Pre-trail me wouldn't stay here to avoid hints of false pretenses, but hungry me will accept favors irregardless of intent. They make a point about prayer services being opt-in. All in all, the vibe is maybe a little off for my liking, but I would pay more than $12 for a meal alone, and this comes with free charging and wifi.

Guinness also has an X-Mid, and he spent some time helping me improve my pitch. It definitely looks much better now. No more getting my tent shoved into my face on a windy night!
