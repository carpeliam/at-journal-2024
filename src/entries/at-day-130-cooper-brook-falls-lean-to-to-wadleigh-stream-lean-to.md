Maine continues to have cool features. I passed a lake! With a tide! It was big! Today was mostly speedy, with a
few sections where I felt like I was running out of gas. Lots of roots, and I d like to think I m ok with them, but
they were getting tired after a while.


Got to shelter by 4 15 or so. Bonk and DK arrived a few hours later, and we chatted about summit plans. Cool to
be summiting with someone I know. I hope I can make to the ranger station in time to get a spot at Birches.
