Maine continues to have cool features. I passed a lake! With a tide! It was big! Today was mostly speedy, with a few sections where I felt like I was running out of gas. Lots of roots, and I'd like to think I'm ok with them, but they were getting tired after a while. I caught a glimpse of Katahdin, with its summit in the clouds.

I got to the shelter by 4:15pm or so, and chatted with some nice section hikers. Bonk and DK arrived a few hours later, and we chatted about summit plans. I think I'm going to summit with them. It'll be cool to be summiting with someone I know - I thought about going lone gun, but there's just too many strangers in this section, and not all of them are great. I hope I can make to the ranger station in time to get a spot at the Birches.

I had a cool "trail provides" experience during dinner. Before lighting my stove, I put my lighter down on top of my lid, which promptly did a 180Âº, plopping my lighter down into my pot of water. I tried lighting the lighter, and no luck. Will it light eventually? I don't know! I asked the woman camped next to me if she might have a lighter I could borrow for a moment or two; not only did she have a lighter, she had *three*, including a piezo igniter. She even let me keep her mini bic lighter! The trail provides!
