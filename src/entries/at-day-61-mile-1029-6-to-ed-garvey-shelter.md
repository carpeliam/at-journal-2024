This hostel has a bit of a weird vibe to it, which just kind of exacerbates a feeling of "this wasn't my first choice". They have a bathroom scale, and now I'm down to 135 pounds. They also have a shaving razor, though, so maybe losing 2 months of beard accounts for some of that weight loss. I hung out with Rachel, and we planned to stop by a spot to eat that I saw yesterday in Harpers Ferry, but (it being a Sunday perhaps?) we couldn't find any parking, and so we ended up abandoning that plan in much the same fashion that I had abandoned staying in town yesterday.

It was still nice to hang out, and Rachel drove quite a ways to come see me, but it was really hard to transition from a headspace of "the trail threw me a curveball and now I need to figure out how to adjust on the fly" to "how do I boil down the experience of 60 days of living on trail to a friend that I get to see for just a sliver of an afternoon?" I don't know that I was a great conversationalist, but sometimes just having company is enough, and I hope that was the case for Rachel too. We got some fried chicken and some ice cream, and Rachel offered me the best trail magic of helping me resupply. And my permethrin order from Amazon was successfully delivered to a nearby Amazon Locker, so we were able to pick that up too.

I said goodbye to Rachel, sprayed my gear with permethrin, and more or less avoided getting back on trail. All in all, I could use a day off trail, but I didn't want it to be at this particular hostel. I managed to convince one of the hostel workers to give me a ride back to where I had left off yesterday, which was a godsend as I didn't actually start hiking until almost 7:30pm and arrived at the shelter just 10 minutes before sunset. Luckily I was able to find a tent spot fairly quickly. I'll never stop being grateful, that I've gotten to where I am with no small amount of kindness from strangers, and friends alike. Harpers Ferry for me was mentally draining, but I've got a full pack again, and back on trail.
