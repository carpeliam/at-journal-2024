Zerooooooooooooo.

SO much chillin'. Every place I walked today was within a city block of everything else. Everything I needed was either at the hostel, at the general store, or across the street at the Monson AT visitors center. And I saw some friendly faces today: Chattaa, Gremlin, and Judge arrived at Shaw's!

It turns out that DK has a leak in her sleeping pad too; we tried the soap test, and found a leak, but when we patched it, it turned out that there were others as well. I was hoping to at least have the same luck in finding the leak on my pad, but we couldn't find it. We even tried submerging it fully in the pond, but we couldn't find anything. I'm not sure what to do. I could buy a replacement here, but I think there was only one or two pads in stock when DK bought one, and I don't have a lot of spare room in my pack. I could also just deal with it for another week or so?

I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get off Katahdin. There's a visitors center with a ranger who can answer all sorts of questions, including "how do I meet up with someone on the summit when I don't know when I'll be there and there's no cell service, and where can they park?". I talked to Ted today and "solidified" a plan for meeting on Katahdin. Trail logistics are hard! I told him I wanted to meet on the summit after hiking up solo, instead of before the summit and hiking up together; I have no idea how I'm going to feel when I get there, but I just want to guard myself and give myself space. Ted has been super accommodating, it's been a relief for him to be so flexible, I know it means a lot of work on his end.

I got into another conversation where I found myself defending New Hampshire. Speedboat was saying it should be more accessible. This feels a bit like the old MacKaye v. Avery debate, where MacKaye fights to uphold a pristine wilderness while Avery fights just to let people see it. As someone who grew up hiking through NH and never once felt like it was too hard (but rather, I just wasn't hardy enough), I would be sad if they changed the trail. It feels almost sacred to me. And NH has probably the highest concentration of day hikers outside of the Smokies, so I don't know that it's scaring people away. I wonder sometimes if it isn't that we get so used to hiking through the mid-Atlantic, we want the ease to continue all the way through, but I don't think that's it; Speedboat hikes faster than I do, I don't imagine he has much trouble with the ascents. And the hiking community, New England included, has a pretty big problem around accessibility, so I don't know why I'm defending the status quo. I think I'm just attached to my mountains. Maybe it's Stockholm Syndrome. I also wonder if I'm just being disagreeable because I'm overtired. But it's rubbed me the wrong way each time when people want the trail to conform to them. Correction: it's rubbed me the wrong way when it was the trail I grew up on; I was one of those people who wanted other sections of the trail to conform to me. I just hope I didn't come off as a dick.

I decided ultimately to forgo the food drop resupply option, and pack enough food for the entire 100 mile wilderness. This'll be a heavy pack, but it feels sturdy enough.
