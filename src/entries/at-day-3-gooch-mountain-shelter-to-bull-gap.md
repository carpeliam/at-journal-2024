I woke up to the sound of Clark and Olivia chatting and making plans. It turns out, Olivia came down with norovirus and started presenting symptoms this morning. I guess symptoms show up around 12 hours after contracting the virus, so I'm really glad now that I didn't borrow that sit pad from Clark. Their plan of hiking for a week through Georgia has been cut short, and now their new plan is to get off trail as soon as possible. I gave them the photo of all the Georgia shuttle drivers, and told them that my shuttle driver Ron was great, but I guess Ron has a full plate and won't be able to get them out until this afternoon. I made oatmeal and coffee, partly as a means to boil the water I had in yet another attempt to keep norovirus at bay, and chatted with them while they planned. This morning was an even later start to my hike than yesterday, not leaving camp until around 9:45. More or less everybody had cleared out before me.

Today's hike included Blood Mountain, the high point of the Georgia section. Ron had made it sound like a challenge, but it didn't seem very strenuous. All around the mountain are these little clusters of short trees, I don't know what they are - I want to call them olive gardens, because that'd be hilarious, even though they're definitely not olive trees. At the base of the mountain is Neels Gap (or Neel Gap, depending on who you talk to or which sign you read) - after the arches and steps and waterfall of Amicalola and the summit of Springer Mountain on Day 1, this was my first AT landmark, home of the iconic [shoe tree](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-appalachian-trail-shoe-tree). It's also the first spot along the trail that sells pizza. They sell frozen pizza, but they'll microwave it *for free*. What a country. I bought a ton of other snacks including a tuna packet, chocolate milk, some iced tea, a lighter and some hand sanitizer, and I think they conned me into buying an extra fuel canister unnecessarily.

While I ate my pizza, I chatted with Dema and Forklift. Looking at FarOut, the ubiquitous trail smartphone app, the next shelter was Vogel State Park, though they charged $25 for tent sites, which didn't sound great. But Dema and Forklift said that just a mile up the trail was Bull Gap, a tent-only campsite that had room for plenty of tents. This sounded great, as I hadn't even considered staying outside of the grounds of a shelter.

I got to Bull Gap and set up my tent, but I don't think I did a great job. This is my first trekking pole tent, and while it looks easy on YouTube, it's definitely not easy for me. Even when I feel like I'm doing it somewhat efficiently, it still takes probably twice as long as those practiced YouTubers. And the tent I have (a Durston XMid Pro) is a pretty popular tent - I wonder if I'll see anyone else with it and be able to grab some pointers. After setting up for the night, I had my first opportunity to cross another milestone off my list: I dug my first cat hole. I've now officially pooped in the woods.
