Olivia has norovirus, sure glad I didn t use their chair
Made oatmeal and coffee
Was able to store/retrieve canister in bear box without ever touching the box, via the kindness of strangers
Got to Blood Mountain - high point though not too strenuous
Decent views, but everything looks similar
Got to Neel(s) Gap, had pizza, chocolate milk, iced tea, bought some tuna and hand sanitizer and fuel
@ Bull Gap, dug first cat hole! Was super windy at night, gusts of 30mph
Sleep score: 50
