Ugh. I didn't sleep at all last night, maybe like 45 minutes or so. I tried covering as many inches of skin as I could with clothing, but the No-See-Ums just focused on whatever wasn't covered. I tried burying my entire self underneath the quilt, but I just did laundry yesterday, I really didn't want to sweat through everything already. I need to make sure I arrive to shelters early enough to score a tent spot, I can't do another night of No-See-Ums.

But enough about bugs. Shenandoah! I saw so many deer. I've heard that this is perhaps the easiest part of the trail to move through, so I moved fast to start (3+ mph), until I kicked a rock HARD and now my 2nd toe is black and blue. ðŸ¤¬ I kind of limp-hiked on from Blackrock hut (damned if this toe was going to shorten the length of my day, I just can't press off that toe but I'm ok), and even limp-hiking, I was still passing the day hikers.

Inside my tent tonight, I literally watched a thunderstorm come on as a wave. First the wind rattled the trees, and then the rain a few moments later, and then the thunder and lightning. Nature is pretty cool.

I finally finished the Brave New World audiobook, after whittling it down during so many nights in my tent. This was assigned reading in high school, which is probably why I barely read it then, but now I can finally appreciate it. And it fits my vibe for this hike too, as someone living just outside of society and not at all convinced that society is right about things. I want to say that I wonder what it'll be like when I finish this, and I'd like to think that it'll be ok but I'm not always looking forward to it. This trail has been a privilege that I'll miss.
