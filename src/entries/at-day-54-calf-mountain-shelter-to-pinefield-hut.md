Ugh. I didn't sleep at all last night, maybe like 45 minutes or so. I tried covering as many inches of skin as I could with clothing, but the No-See-Ums just focused on whatever wasn't covered. I tried burying my entire self underneath the quilt, but I just did laundry yesterday, I really didn't want to sweat through everything already. I need to make sure I arrive to shelters early enough to score a tent spot, I can't do another night of No-See-Ums.

But enough about bugs. Shenandoah! I saw so many deer, as well as a woman peeing on a tree on trail. I tried to give her advance notice by tapping my poles together; she quickly readjusted as though nothing had happened, and looked down at her gear as I passed, avoiding eye contact while I tried to give her at least a little grace. Humans are weird, the whole lot of us. I've heard that this is perhaps the easiest part of the trail to move through, so I moved fast to start (3+ mph), until I kicked a rock HARD and now my 2nd toe is black and blue. ðŸ¤¬ Luckily this was right before a hut, so I stopped in to take a look, but it didn't look as bad then as it kind of does now. There was a guy at the shelter who had found a copper head snake hiding in the rocks of the shelter, and he was trying to get close to it to get a good look. I never really understood the mentality of "oh, a deadly snake, I think I'll go annoy it" but this guy was just showing genuine curiosity, I think that maybe I can empathize a bit.

I kind of limp-hiked on from the hut (damned if this toe was going to shorten the length of my day, I just can't press off that toe but I'm ok), and even limp-hiking, I was still passing the day hikers. I made a rest stop at the campstore. When I told the guy behind the counter that I had just kicked a rock, he said that would make him so angry that he would have punched something. That's all I need, a bruised hand to match my foot. He noticed in my apprehension to reply that our reactions would probably be different, and he complimented me on choosing the less violent path. I'm just trying to walk here, really.

Inside my tent tonight, I literally watched a thunderstorm come on as a wave. First the wind rattled the trees, and then the rain a few moments later, and then the thunder and lightning. Nature is pretty cool.

I finally finished the Brave New World audiobook, after whittling it down during so many nights in my tent. This was assigned reading in high school, which is probably why I barely read it then, but now I can finally appreciate it. And it fits my vibe for this hike too, as someone living just outside of society and not at all convinced that society is right about things. I want to say that I wonder what it'll be like when I finish this hike, and I'd like to think that it'll be ok but I'm not always looking forward to it. This trail has been a privilege that I'll miss, even if I kick my toe occasionally.
