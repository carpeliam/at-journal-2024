I'm in NH! Today was pretty much a nero, and in some ways it was great, in other ways less so. Thumbs up over all, though.

The border VT/NH border is on a bridge, and it took me like 5 or 10 minutes to find the part of the bridge that actually says "VT/NH". I ended up googling for pictures of the bridge by thru hikers just so I could figure out what to look for; finally, I found the one particular piece of concrete that actually beared the "VT/NH" mark. And now, I'm in New Hampshire!

I wasn't really tracking before today that the trail enters NH basically at Dartmouth College, but it does. Hanover NH is basically a college town, and feels a lot like it, even in July when I'm guessing most college kids are out. It also feels like somewhat of a ritzy college town, with some upscale fast casual dining options. I tried a bunch of them. I also scored a free donut! as there's one spot that gives out free donuts to AT thru hikers. I'll take trail magic anywhere I can get it.

One thing I was looking forward to was getting a shower, which is supposed to be pretty easy to do at the Rec Center. But apparently it's only open on weekdays, and today's a Saturday... meaning that I wouldn't even be able to come back and get one tomorrow. Bummer.

Hanover does however have this cool chalk art, showing the path out of Vermont and to Katahdin, that just made everything real all over again. Sometimes milestones don't feel all that special, and other times, something like this chalk art reminds me that, hey, this is a concrete (no pun intended) step toward being closer to my goal. So, I'm in NH now. Woo!

I did a repeat of my Palmerton trick, where I set up my tent in the afternoon and then went back into town sans pack. Not before taking a nap, though. It wasn't nearly long enough, but I'm really trying to get enough sleep.
