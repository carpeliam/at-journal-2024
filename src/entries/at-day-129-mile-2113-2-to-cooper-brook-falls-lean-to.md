I trekked hard in the rain today. So long Hermitage, so long Gulf Hagas (maybe some day I'll come back), it was hard to see much so I kept my head down and pushed on. I was lucky I had camped last night so close to the river; it wasn't that high when I forded it this morning, but it'd probably be a lot higher now. I also had a hard time finding a privy in the morning (I thought it was behind me by half a mile, but it turned out I had camped right next to it!), which set me back almost an hour.

One of the peaks I went over, the last big one I think, had an above treeline summit, and oh the rain! from all angles! I figured though that if I hiked fast enough, I could build up enough heat to avoid hypothermia. That's how that works, right?

I made it to the shelter with about an hour before sunset. The shelter is PACKED, which doesn't bode well for future nights. Who knew the 100 mile wilderness would be full. There were only two tent spots left, and both of them were poor; I took the slightly less poor one, and Smiley got the supremely poor spot. Dude might not be fast, but he's a trooper. Hopefully I'll be able to dry my tent out a bit in the morning!
