I did not go to sleep early as planned. Breakfast, though, was really good, so if food can make up at all for lack of sleep, this morning's breakfast did its damnedest.

This morning I started seeing signs for crossing the Kennebec. I'm not quite sure how far away it is, all I know is that I can't ford it myself. That's good, I don't think I want to.

Maine really showed off today. Rugged beautiful trail on display, all day. These woods are just gorgeous to walk through. And the mountains, and their views! I'd heard southbounders talk about the Bigelows, but I wasn't sure what to expect: were they tough? beautiful? A little bit of the former, but a LOT of the latter. Franconia Ridge, you have been ousted from the top spot. You're very pretty, but the Bigelows are amazing. I feel so full.

I saw one sign along the trail for an "excellent view", and someone wrote in sharpie on the sign "mid". I felt compelled to check it out, and it was yet another stellar view. Even the stellar views here have stiff competition.

After the Bigelows, I had to book it. I passed one campsite that had FarOut comments about flooding in wet conditions, and I don't want to chance it. I made it 5 miles later to Little Bigelow Lean-to by around 7pm, and was surprised to see that Rabbit had stopped at the same place. I had figured she'd have done more miles, but it really is hard to go heads down hard when you're taking in the views from the top of the Bigelows. I asked her if she stopped at the excellent viewpoint, but she said no, she was turned off by the "mid". She missed out!
