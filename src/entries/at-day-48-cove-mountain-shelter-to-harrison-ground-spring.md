I spent most of the day just powering through, but when I got to camp, I just ... sat down, for like a good solid 10 minutes or so. I got to the site before Gambit did, but he had practically finished setting up before I could even start moving again. I definitely didn't eat enough snacks today.

I made the mistake of trying to wash my socks by hand. I don't really know what I'm doing. The more water I poured on them, the more dirt came out, and there was just no end to the dirt, such that by the end of it, they just felt dirtier. Ugh.
