Today was my last full day in the Smokies, and the first day of the trail that felt like a green tunnel! So much of the Smokies is high up (and Newfound Gap was at 5000 feet above sea level), but now that I'm coming down from elevation, the leaves are starting to appear.

I spent a significant amount of time trying to look for bears in trees, not because I was scared they might be there, but because I was sad I might make it through the Smokies without seeing one.

Pretty much every other shelter in the Smokies has come with a tarp to keep the outside out, but Davenport Gap Shelter has a gated chain link fence. Grampy Hippy, another thru hiker staying here for the night, said that all the Smokies shelters used to come with fences, until they started realizing that hikers were feeding the bears through the holes in the fence. Grampy Hippy is an interesting dude; well into his 70s, he's actually finishing his Triple Crown, having completed the other two legs some 50 years ago. To have hiked the CDT in the 70s, when there was barely a paper map let alone a support network, is wild. Rounding out the crew in the Davenport jail was Tortoise (named so because of her poncho that covers her pack), Ray, and a guy section hiking north, about to enter the Smokies.

I really don't understand the privy situation in Tennessee. The word is that none of the shelters in Tennessee have privies, and this is supposed to include shelters on the Tennessee side of the trail in the Smokies, although I can't confirm if this is true or not. In any case, Davenport Gap doesn't have a privy, but rather, a bathroom "area". I feel bad for the women trying to find privacy behind a tree in the "bathroom area". Really not sure what hiking through Tennessee will bring, but I'm glad that the trail doesn't hang out for a while there.
