Spent most of the day trying to catch No Plan, never did. Maybe passed her? As some people indicated early on
that I was right behind her. Oh well.
Another thunderstorm! Waited this one out at the Mt Marshall trailhead. Felt a little smart not trying to hike
through it, and my clothes were mostly dry after it passed.
I'm out of Shenandoah now, Front Royal tomorrow.
