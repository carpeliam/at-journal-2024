I spent most of the day trying to catch No Plan, but never did. Maybe I passed her? As some people indicated early on that I was right behind her. Oh well.

I caught another thunderstorm! I waited this one out at the Mount Marshall trailhead, taking a pretty chill break to eat some snacks while sheltered under a little sign. I felt pretty smart not trying to hike through it, and my clothes were mostly dry after it passed.

I'm out of Shenandoah now, and on to Front Royal tomorrow. This shelter is a bit weird, with a network of blue blazes leading to different tent sites and a water source. It was bittersweet, leaving the park; I'm moving on up, and resupplying tomorrow, but I'm going to miss these waysides and not being limited to the calories I can fit in my pack.
