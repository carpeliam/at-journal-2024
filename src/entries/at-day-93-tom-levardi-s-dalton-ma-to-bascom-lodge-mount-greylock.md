As John is sick, I decided to modify my plan. Originally, I was planning on going up and over Greylock to stay at Wilbur Clearing shelter, but a cyclist in Cheshire mentioned they feed you at a cabin at the top of Greylock.

I got Dunks in Cheshire - it was all that was open. (Technically I could have stopped by Dollar General where Brightside and crew had stopped, but what kind of self-respecting Bostonian could skip out on Dunks, and on the 4th of July no less?) I grabbed some food (including a questionable Ben & Jerry's chunks of cookie dough snack), refilled water, and started the ascent out of town. I tried an aggressive pace that I thought I might be able to keep up all the way to the summit, and it was going so well that I didn't have the heart to stop and hang out with Live Mas when I saw he was taking a break. I had just enough electrolytes/calories/adrenaline to make it to the summit, all 7.7 miles. First time ever summiting Greylock, and I did it in style, or at the very least, speed.

It turns out that there *is* a lodge at the summit, so I went and booked a bunk and dinner. I had dinner with Restless and her family (I met Restless first at Upper Goose Pond and then at Cookie Lady 2.0), and Blue's Clues joined to hang out.

After dark, Blue's Clues and I went outside and watched the fireworks for Adams, North Adams, and more simultaneously from the top of Greylock. Best fireworks ever.
