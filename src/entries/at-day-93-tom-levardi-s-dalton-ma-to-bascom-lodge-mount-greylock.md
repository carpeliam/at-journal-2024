As John is sick, I decided to modify my plan. Originally, I was planning on going up and over Greylock to stay at
Wilbur Clearing shelter, but a cyclist in Cheshire mentioned they feed you at a cabin at the top of Greylock. I got
Dunks (it was all that was open), refilled water, and started the ascent out of town. I tried an aggressive pace
that I thought I might be able to keep up all the way to the summit, and it turned out I had just enough
electrolytes/calories/adrenaline to make it to the summit, all 7.7 miles. I saw that there WAS a lodge at the
summit, so I booked a bunk and dinner. I had dinner with Restless and her family, and Blue's Clues joined to
hang out. After dark, Blue's Clues and I watched fireworks from several different towns all at the same time.
