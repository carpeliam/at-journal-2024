Today was my first zero. It was pretty ok! I tagged along with Brightside and Grave Digger who were planning to hitch to see a movie. Finding a hitch there wasn't too hard, But finding a hitch back from a crowded parking lot in town clothes far away from the trail community was hard. It started raining as we stood outside a gas station, and one guy drove up just to tell us that he thought it might be illegal for us to hitchhike. Finally, someone who had just come from watching the Kentucky Derby picked us up and gave us a ride back. God bless Grave Digger and his ability to make small talk with virtually anyone.

I did a bit of song writing on the piano here at Broken Fiddle. I started in on a second song the other day, just a one liner, but added a tiny bit of a chorus on the piano today. The idea of a trail-inspired music project feels real enough that I told Dana and Dan about "wind river highway". I did a mini concert for Noah, plus a British guy (whose name I unfortunately can't remember) and two women. They were really kind. I miss playing for people. It was kind of cool to just play piano on the porch as the rain came down.

Fire Magic and Live Mas caught up today, but of course they're taking a zero tomorrow so I'll drift from the both of them again. A number of us went across the street to get ice cream at Dairy King. Makes sense that the queen would have a husband, and now I know where he lives. And speaking of ice cream, there was one spot that had affogato potential, but their espresso machine was broken. The trail must not want me to have an affogato. Come on, trail!
