Hard day. It was settling in to be a hard day right from the start - after only a mile or so, I came up on a beautiful spot overlooking, well, everything, and I sat and ate probably too much food. Even here, I can see evidence of people (a logging road, maybe? or electricity wires?), but you really have to look for it. For the most part, it's just open sky, trees, and lakes.

Almost immediately after an extended breakfast, I saw another moose! Err, I saw a moose butt. Its head was hidden by some trees, but I assume it was at least attached to the butt. Indirectly. And almost immediately after the moose butt, I crossed the last milestone: 2100 miles. I don't know what to do with that.

A little while later, the trail crossed paths with a downed plane. From what I hear, everybody involved made it out safely, and the trail was actually rerouted *toward* the site of the crash. I think the opposite happens sometimes when people don't make it out safely.

Around 2 or 2:30, I hit a shelter and sat down to try to figure out where to land for the night. Somebody came up behind me and pressed on, headed for Carl Newhall, but that seems so far away. Also, I was hoping to hit up the Gulf Hagas trail, as it's supposed to be really nice. The weather will likely be terrible, but what if it's not?

I ended up stealth camping right before the river. I have no idea if it's allowed, but as far as I know, there's no camping on the north side of the river, and there were clear spots for tents on the south side. Smiley set up in the same area, so at least there's safety in numbers.
