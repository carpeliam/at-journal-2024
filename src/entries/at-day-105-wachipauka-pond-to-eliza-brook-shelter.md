I'm officially in the 4ks! I went over Moosilauke today. Clouds were moving in and out, wispy little things, but the sky itself was still largely clear. The first moment I could see above the trees and look up at the trail ahead of me, I had simultaneous feelings of being at home at last, coupled with an excitement for what the next few days will be like. I'm finally here!

I lingered for a few minutes at the summit, but there wasn't anyone that I recognized, so I pressed on. The descent was mildly terrifying. It was pretty steep, with the occasional bolted on wooden step to keep you from dying, and all of this right next to a waterfall that stretched pretty much the entirety of the mountain. I made it to the shelter just ahead of a thunderstorm; for the last hour or so, it seemed to be threatening, and when it finally hit, it really hit. I was eating dinner at the foot of the shelter next to Chappy and co., and the storm went from 0 to 60 in a minute or so. I got soaked just trying to put my ursack in the bear box! I had put my tent up at the edge of a group tenting area, trying to leave room for another couple who were right behind me, but they ended up taking a different spot, and so my tent was unnecessarily more susceptible to soakage than necessary. What's a little water though in the night?
