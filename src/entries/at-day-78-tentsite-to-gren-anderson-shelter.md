I really don't like digging cat holes. I'm not good at it, it takes a while, and I'm not good at it. The shelters around here are pretty spread out, so today I walked about a mile out of my way to visit an outhouse.

I stopped at the first shelter, where I met Smokey and had lunch. But then the trail entered a town and I stopped at the Mountain House Tavern. The chicken parm was delicious, and so was the ice water. Heat isn't going anywhere.

I showed up kind of early to the next shelter, and had my pick of tent spots, but none of them are all that great. Baby Kong is going to try his hand in the shelter with the bugs.

I just noticed that there's a road right behind the shelter. I remember that one of the twists in M. Night Shyamalan's *The Village* is that, while you spend the whole movie thinking it's set centuries in the past, it's actually set in modern day, just miles away from suburbia. That's pretty much how I've felt hiking through the mid-Atlantic states.
