The rocks were a bit bigger and scrambly today. I'm a little torn as far as pacing goes. Having to wait for my shoes taught me to be ok with taking my time, but now that I don't have an active reason for going slow, I'm trying to rectify a "last one to Katahdin wins, take your time and enjoy the scenery" approach with a "I want to feel my body move, let's go let's go let's go" yearning. Part way through the day, I heard Kachow behind me, and Brightside and Grave Digger were right behind. I don't even remember how long it's been since I last saw them, probably around Woods Hole. We caught up on gossip, they told me about their time at Trail Days (this confirmed it, it wouldn't have been my thing), and we hiked together to the next shelter, just a bit faster than I had been going before seeing them.

At the shelter, we took a lunch break, but my plan was to stay here for the night and walk into Palmerton, while their plan was to hike on. I went over and set up my tent and took an unencumbered walk down into Palmerton. All in all, the walk there and back was almost as long as my hike today, but it was mostly on concrete sidewalks, without a pack on my back. I almost didn't want to walk back to the trail afterward.
