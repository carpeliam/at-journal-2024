I didn't want to trust that it would actually happen, but I got a new pair of shoes today! I was there to greet the UPS driver as he arrived. I took some pictures of old vs. new, and it's amazing what a difference almost 1200 miles makes. The new shoes have clean soles! The new shoes don't have any holes in them! Who knows what the future brings, but if these shoes last me the rest of the journey, I'll be very very happy.

I wasn't crazy about the Stay-AT-Swatara hostel itself. Some people really like it, as it's very self-serve oriented. You mark down what you take and pay by the honor system. But the way the honor system is enforced is through a number of "smile, you're on camera" signs, which is not my vibe. They did have a really cool pizza oven where the pizza rotates underneath a fixed heating element, so that's nice. I chilled for a bit with Salamander, who I saw hike past Yellow Springs last night, saying he wanted to give night hiking a try. A hiker named Hero had collected a number of mushrooms and used them to create a tea. He offered it to all of us, and although it's probably not the brightest idea to trust complete strangers about mushroom picking, I gave it a try. More or less tasted exactly how I thought mushroom tea might taste, and I haven't died yet.

I know some other hikers have mailed their used up shoes home as a sort of souvenir. I threw mine in the trash. I had a moment of sadness, such a cruel fate for a pair of shoes that supported me for over half the trail, but they served me well, and they had no purpose left in them. I thanked them for their service and threw them out.

Before I even got to the hostel, I put my old shoes through their last set of paces, passing through a marshy spot that was flooded due to beaver activity. It was a fun balancing act and puzzle all in one, how to get from one end to the other without getting wet. I did accidentally dip my foot in partially, but overall managed to stay dry for the most part.

I landed at the end of the day at the 501 Shelter. This is supposed to be kind of an iconic shelter, where you can have pizza delivered, but I arrived pretty late because I was waiting for my shoes and didn't get out of Swatara until almost 5pm. I caught up to Martian in the last few miles, and she didn't think she'd make it in time to order pizza, so I told her I'd order for her. But by the time I got there, daylight was fading, and when I tried to put in an order for pizza, they said they didn't deliver after 8:30pm. *It was 8:31pm.* A few minutes later, Martian came in, and I felt bad that I didn't arrive in time to put in an order for her.

Bonk and DK, who I saw at a shelter the other day, offered us some of their leftovers. The trail provides! But it's dark now. I'm actually kind of proud that I can set up my tent in almost no light by feel and memory alone, but I don't ever want to come into camp this late again. Night hiking is not going to be my thing.
