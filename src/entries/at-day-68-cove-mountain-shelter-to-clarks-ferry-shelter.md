Duncannon. Was planning to hang with Patrick, but he was feeling pretty terrible, not about to drive 7 hours.
Got breakfast at Goodies, then latte (with half & half) at Doyle s, then hung out at Kind of Outdoorsy with
Martian and PBG, and did some grocery shopping. Haven t slept great, and didn t want to hike faster than my
shoes will arrive, so just did a few to the first shelter.
