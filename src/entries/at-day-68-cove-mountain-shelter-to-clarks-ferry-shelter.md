Duncannon. Saw a text this morning from Patrick when I got to the bottom of the hill. He's still feeling pretty terrible, and definitely not about to drive 7 hours. And then it started raining. Walking into town, Duncannon has a much more industrial feeling than any of the other trail towns so far. 2pak (who I think I saw right before Damascus?) called out from one of the side streets, he's hiking with his nephew for a few days. I got some breakfast at Goodies, then a latte (with half & half, pro move) at Doyle's, then hung out at the Kind of Outdoorsy hostel with Martian and PBG. The woman running the hostel was nice even though I wasn't staying, she made me a walking-friendly map to get to groceries and back. Even still, the road to Karns Foods/Dollar General was actively hostile toward anyone on foot. Karns and Dollar General are literally right next to each other, but you have to walk around a blind turn to get from Karns to DG.

Walking with Martian and PBG to get some pizza, Martian (who is actually from Mars, Pennsylvania) said that she likes Duncannon, that it presents the same true honest self to hikers that it does to its residents. I really respect that, I do, but yesterday in Boiling Springs was such a cheery day, and Duncannon has a cloud over it. It doesn't help that today actually is cloudy.

On the way out of town, after I crossed the train tracks and went up the first hill, I paused to pick my nose. This is what passes for personal hygiene sometimes when you're out for miles by yourself, I guess. After a minute or so of digging, I look up, and there's a dayhiking couple on their way back into town. I have no idea how long they've been there. They don't say anything but gesture a little hello, I say hello and let them pass, and we both continue on. 

I haven't been sleeping all that well lately, and I don't want to hike faster than my shoes will arrive, so I finished up just a few miles to the first shelter.
