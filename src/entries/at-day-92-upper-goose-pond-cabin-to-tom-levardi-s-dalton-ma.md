I kind of watched the sun rise over the pond this morning? I should have gotten out of bed a little earlier, but it's hard. The pond was still wonderful, and I had the spot to myself. It was just a really nice spot to slow down. After that, it was time for pancakes. This really is the most wonderful shelter.

I crossed the Mass Pike this morning. I'm so impressed that you can't hear it from the pond; as loud as any interstate is, it was a blessing to have such peace and quiet; such a contrast from hiking in the mid-Atlantic. At some point, I nearly caught up to Kachow and the rest of the crew, but when I turned a corner, they weren't there anymore. I caught up to them later around the Cookie Lady of the North (aka Cookie Lady 2.0), it turns out they found a quicker route that bypassed some of the marshlands. I don't begrudge them a road walk, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing.

The Cookie Lady gave out some pretty good cookies, but what she *really* should be known for is that hibiscus lemonade, *damn*. So good. I tried to make it last, but all good things come to an end eventually.

I hiked out with them and we eventually pulled into the yard of Tom Levardi, a Massachusetts trail angel of sorts who lets hikers tent in his yard. Tom seems like a gift, a fitting emissary of Massachusetts. Dalton is a nice trail town. I ordered an ice cream large enough for pre-trail me to be embarrassed by, but having no shame about ice cream portions is just one of the many perks of being hiker trash. I also made an impulse buy at Cumberland Farms, where they're selling Mountain Dew in red white and blue for the Fourth. You also get a discount if you buy all 3 colors. Somehow Live Mas and I teamed up on my brain and convinced it to pack out 3 bottles of Mountain Dew; I guess I'll be enjoying them somewhere on the top of Greylock tomorrow.

John texted me -- we had originally planned to hike Dalton to Cheshire tomorrow, but he's sick. Bummer! After meeting up with Elizabeth and Rachel in GA and Harpers Ferry, I had high hopes for off-trail meetups, but the logistics since then has been abysmal. Just the same, I'm glad he didn't try to hike on a respiratory infection.
