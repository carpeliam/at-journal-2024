I felt pretty meh for most of today. I woke up early to see the sunrise, but then went back to sleep. Then, I needed to use the privy (with a broken door!), so got a really late start, and just felt sluggish.

The mountains are starting to feel real. There were some ledges (rock faces? slabs?) on Smarts Mountain yesterday, and there were some ledges on Cube today. Though I guess there won't be anything taller than Smarts until Moosilauke. I met a woman at a water crossing who wished me dry weather all through the Whites; I wished her no mud through Vermont. I hope we both get our wish granted.

Toward the end of the day, I was debating with myself where I should end up, when I noticed you could camp at this pond. The FarOut comments were a little confusing and contradictory, and while I was scoping it out, I was afraid I was going to have to settle for a really terrible spot; but then, I heard some voices and followed them around a downed tree to find a beautiful clearing, and now I'm tenting right next to a beautiful pond, watching loons dance across it.

I finally understand why loons are named as such, as they really do sound a bit on the crazy side.

It's really amazing how just the right turn of events can lift a mood. I spent this morning feeling overtired and drained, and now I feel ... well, still overtired, still drained, but relaxed.
