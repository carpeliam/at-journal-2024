I came into some fantastic trail magic around lunch time and used it as a chance to work things out again with REI regarding the shoes. The problem is, they can't ship them to a post office because these shoes ship directly from the vendor (Topo Athletic), and REI's system doesn't allow them to tell the vendor how to ship them. So I spent a good chunk of time trying to find a private address (hostel) that will accept packages and is the right distance away. Long story short, I'm going to have to hike 150 miles from where I started this morning to pick them up, and they're not going to arrive until June 11th. That's about 17 miles per day, far slower than what I've been used to.

But I got to thinking: one of the reasons I was hiking so fast to begin with was to get ahead of the bubble. I don't have to hike 20 miles a day, and I'm pretty sure I can be happy without that. This also makes it easier for Rabbit to catch up to me. So, if you discount the part about having to hike more than half the AT on a single pair of shoes, this is a win. With this newfound freedom, I ended up taking a few breaks today, including getting trail magic for a second time from a guy who had hiked the AT a few decades back, I think in the 70s. I sat for over 30 minutes, chilling out with two hikers named Martian and PBG (Peanut Butter Giant).

At the shelter tonight, I talked about my shoes to a guy coming south (also a flip flopper, didn't start in Maine), who had just come through PA. PA is kind of famous for having a lot of rocks, they even call it Rocksylvania. He said, as long as you get a new pair by Duncannon PA, I'll be fine. I'll get every nickel out of the shoes, but I'll be fine. When I told him I wasn't getting the shoes until some 30 miles after Duncannon, his face visibly dropped.

Oh, but hey, I'm squarely in Maryland now? And it seems to be celebrating its Civil War history via its trail system, with signs along the trail reading "Civil War Trails" with accompanying descriptions of a battle or march etc. I did pass some cool structures today. I think I made a mistake in sleeping here at Pine Knob Shelter, though - it's so close to the interstate, I can still hear the traffic. Weird note: right before crossing the interstate, the trail cut right in between two houses, right next to someone's driveway, and then right behind someone's house. I had to double check the map just to make sure some nefarious well-resourced kidnapper hadn't redirected the AT into the back of their truck.
