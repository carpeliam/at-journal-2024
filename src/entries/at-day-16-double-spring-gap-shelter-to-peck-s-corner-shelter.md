We did it - we woke up far too early to hike 3 miles to the tallest point on the AT. And it wasn't even that hard. The top of Clingmans Dome has a concrete observation tower, and we were there bright and early (with only a small crowd of people who were there before us, the Smokies are the most popular park in the country and this might be its most popular destination) to see the sun diffuse through heavy clouds. I heard later that the clouds melted off by 9am or so, and if we had just gotten up at a normal hour, we would have had a better view (not to mention a better sleep), but doing things reasonably is for suckers. If I wanted to do things reasonably, would I really be out here in the first place?

The observation tower in the books, we walked down the road toward the visitor center as everyone else is planning on doing some road miles. I misheard Brightside as having said there was a vending machine, and soon everyone in the group was full-on expecting it to exist. When we reached the visitor center and it wasn't even open yet, I was only partly devastated. We had breakfast on the stone wall behind the parking lot bathrooms, and it was time to part ways, though I wasn't nervous as I was pretty sure I'd see at least a few people later on today or tomorrow.

The rest of the morning was kind of beautiful, as I walked out of one forest and into another: somewhat dramatically, I stopped seeing trees of one type and started seeing trees of another. I really do need to get better at identifying trees, though I want to say I walked into a variety of pines. There was just enough mist and fog floating through the trees to give it an air of magic. There was also a literal fence enclosure, or exclosure: apparently, wild hogs had been decimating the beech population, so they created a fence to keep the hogs out, and it's wild to see so many beech trees growing in such a small, specific slice of land.

When I got to Newfound Gap, I saw Hitman in a group trying to get a hitch to Gatlinburg - he was tired and wanted a break, but I selfishly was hoping just a bit not to lose people just yet. It was my own choice too, as they asked me if I wanted to come along, but I wanted to keep the inertia going. After they scored a ride a minute or two later, I sat down to trail magic and rested up just a bit.

Walking out of Newfound Gap, I spotted my first sign for Katahdin! I also spotted a noticeable difference in walking speed between me and the day hikers. Of course the one woman who was closest to keeping up with my speed was a retiree from Colorado, the state where outdoorsy people go to live outdoors.

Later on, I caught up with Chris, and I was relieved; I thought everyone I knew had left, and I was alone again on the AT. We met a friend of Tarzan's chilling out at Icewater Shelter, who made an empathetic case for him. There's always another side to someone, and one of Tarzan's other sides is that he likes carrying things as ballast, including dog food. I don't remember Tarzan's friend's name, but I do remember that her dog's name was Cujo, and that Cujo scared away 3 bears at Russell Field shelter a few nights back.

Chris and I carried on. We checked out Charlies Bunion and took pictures, but soon I started to outpace him; there's this constant battle in me between wanting to be social and make friends on trail, and wanting to burn miles, and I feel best about my body on trail when I'm pushing it forward. Today was my first day getting to 20 miles, and my legs and lungs were happy about it, though my feet were pretty tired. I got to Peck's Corner ahead of Chris, and again I was a stranger to everyone in the shelter. Someone in the shelter had an equipment emergency, their hipbelt having attempted to run away from their pack, and I was able to lend them my sowing kit. I don't even know how to use it myself (I'm convinced I could figure out if I had to), but I'm glad to see it's going to good use. Chris showed up a little while later, and it was good to see a familiar face.
