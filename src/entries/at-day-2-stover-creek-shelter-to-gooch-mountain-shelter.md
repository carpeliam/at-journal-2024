It was cold, waking up. As I lay under my quilt, I could already hear the other tents around me, packing up and chatting to each other quietly. Two people accidentally kicked one of my tent stakes -- either camp is crowded, or I need to do a better job pounding stakes into the ground, or both.

I got out of camp kind of late (after 9am?). After about 2.5 miles in, I saw Forklift (who I met in passing yesterday) and her friend Mosey, stopped at a waterfall. I wasn't going to say no to new opportunities, and I walked the 0.2 miles down a side trail to get a view of the falls. I was impressed that Forklift and Mosey already had trail names on just Day 2 -- apparently they had met while hiking the PCT. The falls was nice -- two waterfalls in two days! -- and I wonder a bit if every day will have a little side quest just like this. Mosey offered to take a picture of me with the falls, but I declined; I didn't want to make my journey about me, and I didn't want to stop observing. But Mosey said from experience that one of the biggest mistakes one could make was to not get pictures of themselves along the way, to see how they changed from start to finish. I'll have to keep that in mind, how I can capture my own change without being a tourist of the trail.

Damn, does Sassafras Mountain have steep grade. ðŸ¥µ

Before I started the trail, I planned to use the AT Guide [12 mile](https://www.theatguide.com/12-milesday/)/[15 mile](https://www.theatguide.com/15-milesday/) plans as a baseline for where I might want to stop for the night, given no other factors. But those plans assume you're starting from mile 0 at the summit of Springer Mountain, whereas I started some 8 miles before then, so I subtracted a little from the plan in order to make similar miles. About 11 miles from Stover Creek is Devil's Kitchen, which has spots for 8 tents. But when I got there, it ... didn't look appetizing. It just didn't feel right. And there were some guys taking a water break at the creek right before it, and they were planning on moving on. So I decided to let momentum take me another mile and a half to Gooch Mountain Shelter.

Gooch Mountain Shelter seems like it's well organized out of necessity. As you enter the grounds, there's a map of where all the campsites are, and signs saying that each dirt tent pad should have two tents. I went off to start setting up on an empty dirt pad, wondering who my neighbor for the night might be, as the campground would certainly fill up. Shortly after I finished setting up, Clark and his daughter Olivia rolled in. Olivia was planning to do a large section of the AT (maybe the whole thing), while her dad was planning on hiking with her for just the first week before returning home. When I told Olivia that I was from Boston, she said that she was planning to move to the area after college, but she wasn't sure yet exactly what she hoped to find there -- with a background in music and english, I told her I'd connect her with my friend who teaches in Mass. There was just enough signal to send a text out. Clark offered me the use of his sit pad when he noticed I didn't have my own, and I was just about to graciously accept when I took my hand away at the last moment. He must have been confused until I explained to him about the norovirus outbreak, and we weren't supposed to touch other people's stuff. I think he was grateful that I told him, as he said he didn't know -- they both seem nice. I really like how the trail kind of comes with its own in-built community, and Clark and Olivia and I can all kind of interact as friends, making connections and offering sit pads and sleeping within 5 feet of each other, without ever seeing each other before today.
