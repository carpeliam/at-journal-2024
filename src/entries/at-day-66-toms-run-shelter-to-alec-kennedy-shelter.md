So, um, I don't know if I'm just doing a good job drinking water, or if I'm starting to get old, or what, but I've been pretty good lately at peeing during the night, so good that I had to get up in the middle of the night last night to pee. And I didn't want to bother anyone so I tried not turning my headlamp on, but then I stumbled around and walked into some bushes and then it was time to turn on my headlamp after all. Oh well.

Today was relatively chill. It had to be, as most of the day was spent after CRUSHING THE HALF GALLON CHALLENGE. Though who crushed whom is an open question, as arguably the ice cream took a heavy toll. It took me an hour to ingest 2610 calories, but I did get a free wooden spoon for finishing. There were a good number of us to cheer each other on, including Chattaa, Gremlin, and Judge, who I met last night over dinner. They did the 4 state challenge maybe the day before or so, and they were beat. And I think they were also beat by their ice cream, too, but they were good sports.

After gaining a few pounds in a single hour, I checked out the AT Museum. It had some cool stuff from Heather "Anish" Anderson (TIL pronounced "ANN-ish" not "AnEESH") as well as some cool stuff from the trail's earliest days. The trail from there was forgivingly gentle, aside from a small but cool rocky ridge that seemed to tease what might be to come in a few hundred miles. Tomorrow, I'll check out Boiling Springs.
