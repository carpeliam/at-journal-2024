Yesterday, I thought I might never see Austin again. I ran into him this morning, on top of Siler Bald. The trail is weird.

I got a super late start this morning, setting out at a whopping 10am. I really need to get better at getting up and out earlier. Storm was the only one still in the shelter, huddled invisible underneath a sleeping bag. The blue blaze out of shelter was rock and mud and a bit annoying to navigate, but once the path crossed the AT and headed straight up to Siler Bald, it got a bit easier, if you don't mind steep. I saw two guys take their packs off to lighten their load as they walked up the hill, but I made a point (for no good reason at all) of trying to catch up to them while wearing mine. I did not expect one of the guys to be Austin. Austin introduced me to Siesta, who he had met hiking out of Winding Stair Gap yesterday.

Side note: Siler Bald Shelter is connected to the AT via the Siler Bald Trail, looping in both directions. Don't tell anyone, but instead of walking south on the Siler Bald Trail to reconnect to where I had left the AT, I walked north instead, and in doing so, missed about a half mile of the AT. Please don't tell anyone.

The top of Wayah Bald seemed like a good lunch spot for Austin, Siesta, and me. It has a cool observation tower, you can see for miles. As we sat there on the north side of the tower to escape the wind, it started snowing - actually, it was sleet! And it was still super windy, so it was blowing everywhere, truly wild. Really fun to hike through, especially as it didn't accumulate.

My original plan today was to stop at Cold Spring Shelter, but when I got there, I just didn't like the vibe. As I refilled my water, Siesta caught up to me, and we chatted about where to end up. He was planning on pushing on to Wesser Bald Shelter, another 6 miles up trail, to put us in a good place to get to the NOC tomorrow and then the Smokies. That'd be a long day, but I felt that I could do it. And we did do it! Siesta's fast, though. I feel like I've been able to offset my late morning starts by walking around 2.7 miles and hour, sometimes a bit more, but I'm barely keeping up with Siesta. It turns out he's a true ultralight hiker: he doesn't carry a power bank, he's cold soaking his food, and he sleeps on a thin foam pad. Bad ass.
