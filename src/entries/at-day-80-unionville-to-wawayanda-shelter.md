I was sitting on the front steps of the general store this morning, and who did I see walking by, but the Colonel! I was wondering where they had landed - turns out, they had stayed at the pastor's house, and it was apparently really nice. I should have checked!

The trail went through a national wildlife refuge this morning. I had some competing thoughts: on the down side, building a home for wildlife and expecting them to live there is kind of like building a Native American reservation and just expecting them to stay inside the boundaries- land ownership is not a universal concept. On the plus side, can you believe that we created a place with benches where people can just sit and watch things that are alive? And this is a very meditative place! You can just *be*!

I think I'm tending to dwell on the negative thoughts a bit due to lack of sleep.

I spent the afternoon with the Colonel, Baby Kong, Bonk, and DK. We took a good long break today at a farm and garden center, mostly because it had stellar air conditioning. And the longer we hung out around the AC, the less we wanted to go hike up the next thing, which was the Stairway to Heaven. Basically the first real ascent in a while! It was good, but tough in the heat.

We're all tenting at the shelter tonight. There's also some overnight hikers staying inside the shelter. I find it kind of cute now to see someone do an overnight - good on you, friend, for getting out of your comfort zone and coming out here! I felt for them tonight as it ended up being a wet one. We ended up getting to the shelter with just enough time to make dinner and fill up on water before it started pouring.

Movie tomorrow! The Colonel arranged for a shuttle, but we've got to hike 10 miles to get there by 11am. I can't sleep in too much!
