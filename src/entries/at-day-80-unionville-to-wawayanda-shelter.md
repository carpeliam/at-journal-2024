National wildlife refuge
Negative: building a home for wildlife and expecting them to live there is kind of like building a Native American
reservation and expecting them to live there- land ownership is not a universal concept
Positive: can you believe that we created a place with benches where people can just sit and watch things that
are alive? And that this is a very meditative place! You can just BE 😍
Movie tomorrow ! At 1376, 10.1 miles
