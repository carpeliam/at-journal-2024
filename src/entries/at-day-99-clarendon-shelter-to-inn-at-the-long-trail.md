Ugh. I had some good milestones today! 500 miles from Katahdin, and I passed the 1700 mile mark. But ultimately, today was really hard.

I got wet coming over Killington. There was a thru hiker I met in northern MA (I forgot her name, but she kindly lent me some water when a shelter's water source was far away and a trickle to boot) who caught up to me while I was having a breakfast snack at Governor Clement. I caught up to her on the way up Killington, and we got up to the top together. We were trying to go fast, as we didn't want to get caught in bad weather. We made it a pretty long way before it started raining hard, but the mountain is bigger than I remembered, and it was a bit anxiety inducing. By the time we got to the top, though, it seemed pretty safe to go down the other side. I stopped at the summit to refill on water, and she went on ahead.

I was pretty set on finishing the day at the Inn at the Long Trail. Last year, I got there early to make sure I got a spot. For whatever reason this year, I didn't think I'd need to get there so early. I'm an idiot; when it's raining outside, inns fill up. When I pulled in around 3:30pm, they were all out of vacancies.

I just spent a good chunk of my morning thinking about all the things I was going to do when I got to a nice room at the inn, and now I have to stay in my dirty wet clothes for I'm not sure how long. I've been experimenting with being comfortable being uncomfortable, rearranging my expectations about hygiene when I can't take a shower every day, but right now I just feel slovenly. Whatever invisible line I'm searching for between living in society and living like an animal, I think I passed it, and now I'm just upset and sad.

I was able to set up my tent across the street from the Inn for free, at least, so it's not all bad. But I don't think I'm going to have time to do laundry or be able to take a shower, and now that it's in my mind that I need one, I feel like I'm in a deficit right now.

I took the shuttle to Rutland and got my resupply in, but realized I had missed the last easy shuttle back. Luckily, these two LT hikers I had met on the shuttle made the same mistake, and had called an Uber. There was some stress as none of the Ubers were picking up our request, but it worked out in the end. (Also, I saw Brightside leaving Walmart right as we were getting picked up, I guess they're staying at the Yellow Deli?)

Tonight was a nice night: the two LT hikers I had met were both playing guitar in the lounge, and I joined them on the piano. (I had been looking forward to this piano since before setting out.) After that, we shared dinner, and I'm excited for these guys to set out toward Canada.

I've had Robert Frost on the brain lately. I've crossed the same stone walls that inspired me last year, and today, at Maine Junction, two roads diverged in a wood. Last year, I took the road less traveled, but today, I took a right turn. But though I'm taking the road *more* traveled, this is where I diverge from the path I've taken before. I've gotten some comfort from walking along familiar miles, and tomorrow, I'm leaving the familiar behind. I'm a little nervous, but north is the one direction that points home.
