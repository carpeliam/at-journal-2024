At the shelter in the morning, I met Apparition, who had arranged a shuttle into town and agreed to split it with me. After a pretty quick 2 mile hike down to the road (the only other easy section of trail in NH so far), I piggybacked off his shuttle and headed back to the Gorham Walmart, apparently the last Walmart of the entire trail. After resupplying, I hitched to McDonald's without even asking, then shuttled back at 11:15am.

The rest of the day was more or less covered by mist, and I can almost feel the White Mountains giving way to Maine. I'm less than 5 miles away from the Maine border. There's a part of me that can't believe it, but there's an equal part of me that feels like it's inevitable.

At the shelter tonight (I think I might be far enough north to avoid some mosquitos?), I met Ovenbird and Songbird, who are also from Mass. Ovenbird is named so because there's an actual bird called an ovenbird (TIL), and its cry of "teacherteacherteacher" matches Ovenbird's occupation. Songbird's trailname comes from being a singer, and as it turns out, we share some of the same places in our past; she seems to be more embedded in the Cambridge music scene (Lizard Lounge et al) now than I was when I lived there. She's carrying a guitalele (a 6-string guitar/ukelele hybrid), which is kind of amazing - I had thought about carrying a cheap uke and had given up, but carrying something twice as large all the way to Maine is pretty damn impressive.
