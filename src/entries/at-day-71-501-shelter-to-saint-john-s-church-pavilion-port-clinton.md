Today just felt like the hardest day on the trail. I mentioned this to DK tonight at the shelter, and I don't think it made any sense to either of us why today would be so especially hard for me today. It probably didn't help for me to bust out 11 miles in under 4 hours last night on a brand new pair of shoes. I forget that sometimes shoes need to be broken in just a little bit, and my heels are a little tender now.

I'm also firmly in Rocksylvania now. When I first heard that northern PA would be rocky, I couldn't picture it in my mind, but now I see. Just enough rocks to break your rhythm, sharp enough that you don't want to put your weight on them. From what I understand, when glaciers were moving south during the last ice age, they left some good sized boulders up in NH, but what made it down here to PA were the crumbs.

I did manage to pass 1200 miles today though. Another really pretty milestone, with numbers spelled out in sticks surrounded by stones. A lot of today was actually pretty, with some pretty views of the valley, sparse woods, and pretty flowers. The descent into Port Clinton sucked though. It was super steep, and landed me in a train yard. This seems to be another industrial town. I set up my tent in a big grassy area (private land, owned by the Saint John's Church who asks for donations from hikers who stay) - iMom, Bonk, and DK are staying in the pavilion itself, across the street.

I tagged along with Bonk and DK in a shuttle to the nearby Walmart, and Bonk introduced me to Wawa. I never knew that a gas station could fill this niche, and now I wonder why gas stations everywhere aren't like this. At Walmart, I bought a pint of Ben & Jerry's, a pint of chocolate milk, and a full-sized pie in memory of Rabbit and Fluff. Bonk said he had never met anyone with such a high tolerance for dairy; I said I'm not so sure my stomach has that high of a tolerance, but my taste buds do. I think I just really need the fat.
