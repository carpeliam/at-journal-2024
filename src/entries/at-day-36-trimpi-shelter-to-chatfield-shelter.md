We added a new friend today, hiking with Tennessee Switch who we met at the shelter. And Liberty found us, too! We heard we might be able to get hot showers and pizza around Partnership Shelter, about 10 miles in, so we made that our lunch destination. Turned out that the showers were turned off (though it is a fancy looking shelter!), so we walked just a little bit farther to the road where we could order pizza, right outside a visitors' center. We ordered *so much food*. We tried hard to eat as much as we could, but ultimately we moved my food from my bear canister into Rabbit's bear bag, and stored the leftover pizza in my canister, which might stay edible for a day or so. I don't know how food works.

I weighed myself on the scale in the visitors' center, and I'm down to 140 pounds. That's down from 144.4 at Broken Fiddle, and this time I'm wearing all my clothes. I don't know how accurate these scales are, but I'm definitely losing weight and I don't think the pizza is going to put a huge dent in that.

Around the end of the day, we walked through a small patch where you could see charred ground. Controlled burn, maybe?
