PBG and Martian tented out a mile past the shelter at a nice view, and I caught up to them while they were taking down. This was a nice spot to have some breakfast, so I chilled out for a bit with them. Just a little bit later, I ran into an older couple doing trail magic, and we sat and had twizzlers and oranges and asked when the rocks would get rocky.

There was a second trail magic stop later in the day, from a mother/daughter team. The mother mentioned that she always wanted to the AT, but eventually the years got away from her. I didn't tell her that a fear of the same happening to me was a motivating factor for me being out here in the middle of my life, but I definitely thought it.

I got to Yellow Springs campsite around 7pm or so, and while the cold brew from the second trail magic was pushing me to continue to Rausch Shelter, I think I'll stop here for the night. It seems cozy enough, and there's a mailbox with a trail log in it. Martian and PBG came in a little bit after me and set up close by. I did the math, and I should get to Stay-AT-Swatara before noon tomorrow.
