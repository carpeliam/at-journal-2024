Oh man. Day #1 on the AT! It was enough just getting here -- I took the train down the previous night (yes, the [Midnight Train to Georgia](https://youtu.be/A0F9lh8TiSM?si=WNNgeRtjFpZy0PGU)), paying a bit more for a fold-out bed but not like it was easy to fall asleep anyway. On the ride down, I was massaging my foot, dealing with some muscle tightness from an impromptu run the day before. Well, however ready my body is or isn't, I'm here.

The train pulled in about 30 minutes late into Gainesville GA but [Ron](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063487306565) my shuttle driver made it work. On the ride there, Ron quizzed his three passengers on preparedness: did we know about the norovirus outbreak? did we know about long water carries? how much water were we carrying? In almost every fact that Ron talked about, there was at least one kernel I wasn't already aware of. One of the other passengers had attempted the AT last year, and made it nearly a week before stopping; she knew her knees wouldn't see her to Katahdin, but she just wanted to get farther this year than she did last year. The other passenger was carrying a portable CPAP machine to manage his sleep apnea. And here I was with a 40L pack, thankful that the electronics portion of my base weight was so much more manageable.

Ron dropped us off at the Amicalola Falls Visitor Center, where I was just in time to sign in, get my hang tag, weigh my pack, and attend a short slideshow lecture on the Georgia part of the trail. One thing that stuck with me was the advice to only hike around 8 miles each day in the first few days, even if my lungs and muscles were fine with more, due to the time it takes for ligaments/tendons to warm up. It sounded like good advice, and I plan at least to not totally ignore it. I took one last photo of a sheet marked "GEORGIA SHUTTLE DRIVERS", made sure I had everything, and walked on out, as the next wave of arrivers was getting started with the same slideshow lecture. It was 10am by this time, and I needed to get this party started if I wanted to make some miles and get to camp at a decent hour.

Just as I was walking out, I saw Haroula, a fellow Bostonian whose sister was apparently starting the trail on the same day as me. Haroula's whole family had come down to see her sister off. Haroula called out to me as I left the visitor center, and I told her about my eventful train ride down. She told me her sister had started an hour ago, but was planning to camp at the same shelter I was. I was excited to come into the trail already "knowing" someone, even if I only actually knew her sister, and not even that well.

The beginning of the approach trail was a bunch of stairs. There was some renovation going on, so the normal path up the "Stairs of Death" (a respected rite of passage) was inaccessible; in their stead were an equally grueling set of stairs. But once I got up, there was still a beautiful sight to take in: the tallest waterfall in the state of Georgia.

The top of Amicalola Falls was approximately 1 mile into my day, but I still had another 7 miles to get to the top of Springer Mountain where the trail actually began, and then another 3 miles to get to my shelter destination of Stover Creek. The hike up was pretty manageable, and the wooded summit still gave a good view on the mountains Somewhere Out There. But now I'm actually on the trail. The one with the white blazes. While chilling out at the summit, I met Brad, from Florida. Brad was also thru hiking, but his parents had come up to Springer to hike with him on his first day. I chatted with them a bit about the excitement, nerves, and expectations, but soon I said goodbye and gave them the mountain to themselves.

I finished up at Stover Creek Shelter around 3:30pm, leaving me a few hours before sunset to set up my tent and get dinner. I found a cozy piece of ground outside the shelter to make food; norovirus stuck around on surfaces for periods of up to 2 weeks or so, which made the shelters themselves somewhat off limits. While I ate, I chatted with someone who turned out to be Dema, Haroula's sister. A little while later, Thomas and Kyler came over and hung out, and we all chatted about expectations. Thomas had hiked as far as Virginia a few years back, and that opened up more questions. What were the Smokies like? How were resupplies? But we also all wondered, how big was the thru-hiker turnout this year? How big would the bubble be? As much as I want to let the trail wash over me, I also want to get past the bubble. It seems like a lot of hikers signed up to start in March, and given that no one is staying in the shelters, the tent sites will likely be packed.

It was pretty cold and windy by the end of the night, down to around 38Âº, and the next few nights are supposed to be colder. I guess I'll learn all about what Georgia mountains are like in Spring.
