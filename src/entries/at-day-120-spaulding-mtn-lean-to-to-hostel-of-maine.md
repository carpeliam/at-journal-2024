2000 miles! It was pretty tough getting there, though. There was an ugly steep descent off Sugarloaf in the morning, and I fell twice. Just stupid falls, really - I'm still not sleeping well, I think the sleeping pad leak is getting bigger. The second time I fell, I told Rabbit to go on without me. It's something I've been trying to find a way to say - I prefer hanging out at camp, experiencing the trail solo - and when I said it, she asked me if I was sure, as if maybe she's been wanting to let her legs free and I was holding her back. Maybe we miscommunicated on that.

Bonk and DK are staying at the Maine Roadhouse hostel, and Rabbit booked a spot at the Hostel of Maine. I go wherever the people go, so I told Rabbit I'd tag along to the Hostel of Maine with her, mostly so she wouldn't feel alone. She had already been there for a bit when I arrived, about to tear into a pint of ice cream. I had an idea about sending Fluff a "here we are hanging out together with matching pints of ice cream" photo, so I tried check in quickly and buy some ice cream as the very first thing I did before settling down. When I got back to the porch with my pint, Rabbit was already well into her ice cream, and I kind of snapped a little bit, like "hey I thought we were gonna take a photo together for Fluff". As soon as I said it, I recognized my tone was off, my whole self is off, and I need a solid night's sleep. I'm staying in a bunk tonight, hopefully nobody around me has sleep apnea.
