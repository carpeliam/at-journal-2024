You know how they say, when it's hot you should start early? We just couldn't do it today. It's so hot, we didn't want to leave. But we finally got a move on, and now I'm out of Pennsylvania, and past the 1300 mile mark!

I've heard that the New Jersey section of the trail over-delivers, and reminds you that it's the Garden State after all. That seems probably true, but I spent most of the day trying to avoid the sun. My mom texted me last week about a "heat dome", which must be the meteorologist term for it, but around here we just like to say that it's pretty freakin' hot outside.

I ended up walking a bit today with Baby Kong and Colonel. The three of us stopped by the Mohican Outdoor Center for some food, a cold drink, and some ice cream. Afterwards, they took the road back to meet up with the trail, but I went the purist route and walked back to where I had left the trail. Honestly, I think it was a more interesting walk- the climb out of the MOC was the only little steep part of the day, and mmaybe it even built some character, or at least a little bit of muscle, for when the hills come back further north. 

 NJ has a lot of "unofficial" tent sites with lots of tent spots. I ended up staying at the same spot as Baby Kong, Colonel, and iMom, which happened to be next to some good flowing water that didn't come straight from a bog.
