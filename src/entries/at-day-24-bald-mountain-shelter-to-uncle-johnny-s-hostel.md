Met Rabbit late the night before
Also last night, chatted with Fire Magic about tramilies- she said some people you don t see for a while, some
people you only hike with for a day, related story of creepy Sunlight being predatory toward Cinderella
Sunrise hiked to Big Bald with Fire Magic- seemed like it might be overcast but actually got great views
Rabbit left early in morning, I got the sense she might have started after me
Decided to bust out a fast first 10 miles to first shelter
Caught up with Fire Magic at top of first hill
Caught up with Rabbit before the main road/gap
She caught up to me about 0.5 before shelter
I ate my food while waiting for Fire Magic
MJ and Abby, two girls I had passed twice, stopped there, lunched and kept going
Decided to head in to Erwin while Fire Magic was still having lunch so I could get some chores done
Got to Uncle Johnnys and saw Live Mas and Lost, caught up a bit, but it was still raining so no chores
Rabbit walked 2 miles into town
Fire Magic arrived, we did laundry together
I got shower in small stall
Loaner clothes were meh
Got Mexican food in loaner clothes while clothes were still in dryer
Food was meh but portions were big, couldn t finish
Fire Magic will do zero tomorrow, reconnect with Snail Mail and Honeybuns
Rabbit indeed has higher number than me, started on April 6
Lives in converted school bus with oak floors
Makes own pemican
Plans to do 20 to 30 miles a day
Hopes to meet a tramily that also does similar distances but doesn t want to sacrifice movement
I feel similarly with everyone I ve hiked with (but couldn t match Rabbit s pace), and will be leaving Fire Magic
tomorrow and most likely won t see again

Sleep score: 45
