The sunrise hike happened! It initially seemed as though it might be overcast, but we actually got some beautiful views.

In my haste to get up for sunrise, I didn't pull out any snacks for the day. A normal person would stop, take a moment to enjoy their surroundings, maybe? and take out some snacks from their pack before repacking and starting out again. But that would take too long, so I decided to bust out the first 10 miles of the day and figure out food at the first shelter. I caught up with Fire Magic at the top of the first hill, and there was a moment where she might have thought I would hike alongside her as I did the other day, but I explained poorly that I didn't pack snacks very well so I was going to hike fast. Writing this now, I don't think that makes any sense.

Reflecting, I think there are maybe 3 reasons that I hiked fast this morning? One, because I get anxious about taking breaks when I could be moving, two, because Rabbit is an enigma and I'm curious if I could catch up to her, and three, I wonder if I may have given Fire Magic a weird impression last night. The fact that I have enough energy to get pretty poor sleep last night but still hike 10 miles without eating anything is just icing.

I caught up to Rabbit just before Spivey Gap. She asked me if I saw this gigantic tree a little while back, and this interaction sticks with me because I missed it, and I conflate missing a gigantic tree with hiking too fast to notice the little (or big) things. But I guess it goes both ways, as I remarked to Rabbit about how quiet this gap was, and she said she didn't notice on account of wearing headphones. I guess we all notice the things we notice.

I passed Rabbit, but she leapfrogged me around a half mile before the shelter as I was getting water. I arrived at the first shelter and ate lunch before rearranging my pack and waited for Fire Magic to catch up. I originally anticipated hiking into Erwin with Fire Magic, but as she made her lunch, I reconsidered, wanting to get to Uncle Johnny's soon so that I could get some chores done.

While I was on the Long Trail, I saw one interaction that sort of redefined how I see thru hikers hiking together. As I was having breakfast with a guy, his friend announced he was planning to start walking for the day. The guy I was chatting with replied that he'd be ready in 20 minutes, after he finished his breakfast and hit the privy. I expected some sort of negotiation, either a "I can wait 20 minutes" or "I'll eat quickly", but instead, both did exactly what they said they were going to do, and hiked separately for the morning. I guessed that, when you're hiking almost 2200 miles with someone, you don't have to hike all of those miles together. But I'm a consensus-driven person by nature, and I'm still figuring out how to make decisions independently of the people around me.

When I got to Uncle Johnny's, I ran into Live Mas and Lost and caught up a bit. That bit about reconnecting with people you haven't seen for a while is really true - I don't think I've seen Live Mas since I met him at the Fontana Hilton. It was still raining, so I ended up holding off on chores, but Rabbit walked the two miles into town to pick up some cork so she could hand-carve her own insoles. That's pretty badass. Fire Magic arrived shortly thereafter, and we did laundry together. The loaner clothes here aren't quite as cool or comfy as those at Laughing Heart, but the outdoor shower was novel and felt good.

We all went out for Mexican food. I think this might be the worst Mexican food I've had in my life, but as always I'm grateful for the calories, and the portions were large enough that I couldn't even finish my meal. I think my hunger now outstrips the physical limitations of my stomach.

Rabbit indeed does have a higher number than me, and started on April 6th. She lives in a converted school bus with oak floors, and makes her own pemican. She's planning to do 20 to 30 miles a day. My wanting to get miles out of my body doesn't in any way compare to her wanting to see how far she can push her body. I asked her about this war (that I've been fighting internally) between hiking socially and hiking aggressively. She said she'd like to meet a tramily that also does similar distances, but she doesn't want to sacrifice movement. I feel similarly, even if our ideas of pushing ourselves are scaled differently. Fire Magic is planning to take a zero day tomorrow and reconnect with Snail Mail and Honeybuns. As cool as it would be to see the both of them, I don't want to sacrifice movement, so I guess that means sacrificing hiking with Fire Magic, Snail Mail, and Honeybuns.

Talking to Live Mas, I learned that not everybody is out here for the same reasons. (Shocking.) I mean, some people see this as a vacation, and when the days get hard or the weather turns sour, and they type 1 fun isn't happening, they take a rest day and have fun off trail instead. I guess that makes sense, but if you wanted a vacation, why not a cruise, or hike the Camino de Santiago where your gear and meals are taken care of, instead of hiking with your tent on your back for 2200 miles? I came out here because home life is far too comfortable, and I want to be comfortable being uncomfortable. But we're all out here for different reasons, at different life stages.

We had this conversation in conjunction with my decision to tent in the rain, instead of staying in the bunks. Live Mas and Rabbit collectively convinced me to "upgrade" to a bunk. Of course it stopped raining shortly thereafter.
