On the way out of town this morning, we stopped at a barbecue spot. This seems like the epitome of good local establishment - we had stopped by yesterday on the way to the hostel, but FarOut was a little confusing, and we were peering into the windows of a closed shop. The owner noticed us, and invited us in for a minute for a cold drink. We came back this morning and I'm pretty sure that both Guinness and I tipped well for yesterday's kindness.

A pretty big milestone today: I'm more than halfway to Katahdin. At this point, it's probably easier to just walk home than to return to Georgia. (That's always been the case, I guess? but now I'm closer!) We also passed the 1100 mile mark, which was the most decorated mile marker I've seen yet; both sticks AND stones.

And to top it off, as we were closing in on the shelter for the night, Guinness and I saw a peacock on trail. No idea if it was born here or escaped a zoo. I caught it on video, but just barely.
