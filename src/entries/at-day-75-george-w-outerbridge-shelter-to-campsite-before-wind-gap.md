The hike out of Palmerton was so wonderful! It was everything I wanted a rocky scramble to be, and got me excited about getting back into elevation again.

Today was a pretty big water carry. I had to walk almost 0.5 miles off trail past one of the shelters to get water. FarOut comments seem to indicate that some guy is slashing or tossing water caches that people put out, all because his last name is on a semi-reliable spring more than 0.5 miles off trail and he wants people to use that for their water. I passed his spring today and didn't get water there out of principle and also I didn't want to walk more than a mile for water. Tomorrow is supposed to be similar, but there's supposed to be a hotel nearby where I can fill up.
