This morning's walk was a pretty big departure from the last few weeks. Instead of walking in the mountains at around 4000 or 5000 feet above sea level, I walked over the dam today at around 1700 feet above sea level. Immediately following the dam, there were National Park Service signs for "Great Smoky Mountains National Park", and shortly after that, the box to deposit the entry portion of my Smokies permit. The way the permit system works is, you print out your permit ahead of time, rip it in half, stick half of it in a box upon entering, and stick the other half in a box upon exiting. I'm not sure how often they collect the permits, but this morning the entry box was full.

I'm not really sure what to expect from hiking through a National Park - I kind of feel like it should be an even more pristine form of nature than I've been hiking through so far.

Today was my first chance to go up a fire tower on a clear day, and I took it. Two years ago, on an overnight hike in Vermont, I walked right by a fire tower on top of Stratton Mountain, and when I went up Stratton again while on the Long Trail this past year, it was socked in with no chance of views. It left an imprint that opportunities are finite and fleeting and unpredictable, and I resolved to climb every fire tower I could if it were a clear day. Shuckstack gave me my first choice, and while it didn't disappoint, it was maybe a bit... too much. A few days ago, coming down into the NOC, the view unfolded and revealed itself like a story, but the view from Shuckstack was a bit like that at the Grand Canyon, where you're presented with all of it all at once, with no build-up or release of dramatic tension. I'm not disappointed! just a bit overwhelmed. There's just so much.

I saw Hitman having lunch at Mollies Ridge and stopped to grab a snack, but kept moving after a few minutes when I got sick of the flies surrounding the campfire pit. Just a few steps later, I saw my first deer! And, I saw a really colorful millipede this morning. Maybe hiking through a national park *will* show me an even more pristine form of nature than I've seen so far.

I got to Russell Field, my home for the night, and it was covered by a tarp. The same was true with Mollies Ridge shelter, I'm not sure what the deal is. To protect against bears? To protect from high winds at high elevation? Unknown. Some familiar faces were there, including Thomas (now known as Brightside?) and Kyler. Dema walked by, exclaiming "Hi Liam!", and I shouted back, "It's Marathon now!" I no longer answer to *"Liam"*. Forklift and Mosey were there too, and Forklift let me take some pictures of her tree identification book. Each page had a picture of leaf patterns, a picture of bark patterns, and paragraphs about identification and habitat. It's been an objective of mine to learn how to identify trees while I'm out here, and now I'd be armed with real knowledge. At least, when it comes to distinguishing between different species of Oak.
