Resupplied in Daleville
Too much coffee, then bbq, then $$ at Kroger, then hung out at coffee while charging things
Still trying to figure out how much food to buy- it seems as though the amount of calories that will fit in my bag
is not enough calories to keep me from losing weight
Walk out of town was nice and gentle
Sheltered with Gambit and Star Trooper
