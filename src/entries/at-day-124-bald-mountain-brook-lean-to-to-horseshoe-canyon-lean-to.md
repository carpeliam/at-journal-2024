Two stream crossings
Pretty straightforward day. Only one mountain, and it had the good sense to be the first thing I did. Just the
same, I dragged a bit, as I don t have enough snacks, so I was rationing. Still, it was thankfully a very easy day.
Got to shelter at 1 30 - it started thundering around 2, and stormed around 2 30. Again, I was lucky not to have
to hike in that. Not too many at shelter tonight- one section hiker going south, and 1 tent with two guys I saw at
yesterday s shelter, also headed NOBO. I ll probably see some familiar faces at Shaw s tomorrow.

I hope everything works out with my Mail Drop!
