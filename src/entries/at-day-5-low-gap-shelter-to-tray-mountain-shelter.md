Saw Tom on trail, we tried to figure out with 1 bar whether hiker feed was on Mondays (as AT Guide said) or
Wednesdays and Thursdays as some Far Out comments said. I realized that my 15 mile plan had me getting to
Hiawassee from Dick s Creek instead of Unicoi, and I met Sink not far from the shelter close to Unicoi who said
it was going to rain Tuesday, with thunderstorms on Thursday. I made a game time decision to stretch for
Dick s Creek Gap, and told Sink to tell Tom that I d try to meet him there. The heat is going to start and I don t
know if I m going to like it!
Got hotdog and milk at Unicoi trail magic. Only a few hours apparently behind Dema/forklift. Trail magic lady
gives out cool trail names, including Fat Bottomed Burl for the guy who found a big burl at the bottom of a tree.
Met him and Chicken Little at an overlook a few hours later.
