I got to the road for Front Royal around 9:15am, and was just taking a picture of their trolley schedule when a car pulled up and a hiker got out of the passenger seat. I asked the driver if he was headed back into Front Royal, and he said he was; I asked him if he could give me a ride, and he said he could. This was an even easier hitch than in Glasgow! I hopped in. The driver had hiked a good portion of the trail himself, and had a trail name of Smooth. He taught marksmanship at a local firing range, and he applied the same lesson he taught there to the trail:
> Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
I've never heard this saying before, and I think I really like it. Maybe I can use this to get better at standing up my tent.

Front Royal was really nice. I got my second affogato of the trail (it wasn't on the menu, but they knew what they were doing). Smooth had dropped me off right in front of the local outfitter, and apparently they were working together with the local brewery and bakery to offer a spot to do laundry and take a shower. Good on them, and I ended up patronizing all but the brewery. I signed their whiteboard wall too, inspired to join the 'A' and 'T' of Marathon into an AT symbol. They had a bathroom scale next to the shower, and I'm down to 137 pounds now. Ugh. After cleaning up, I walked down to the visitor center to check if I'd have enough time to hit up the grocery store before the trolley returned to the trailhead; it looked doubtful, so I decided to resupply at the outfitter's instead. While I was there, a guy offered me a ride back to the trailhead without me even asking! The people here are SO NICE. On the way back, he talked about his hobby of overlanding, and we compared our experiences of getting away from it all for days (or months) at a time.

I wrote a few days back about sometimes being underwhelmed by even the most epic Virginia views. Well, sometimes they still get me. Virginia really does have some pretty hills.

Since the beginning of the trail, I've been kind of triangulating mileage based on how I feel, where others are landing, and the 3 itineraries available on the AT Guide website. When I started, the 15 mile plan was closest to my speed, but at least right now, the 18 mile plan seems closest to how far my legs want to go. But the plans are still pretty old, and today the 18 mile plan mentioned a shelter that doesn't exist anymore. Turns out it's been replaced by Whiskey Hollow shelter. I arrived a little on the late side, around 6:45pm. I don't know anyone in the shelter, but everyone seems nice enough.
