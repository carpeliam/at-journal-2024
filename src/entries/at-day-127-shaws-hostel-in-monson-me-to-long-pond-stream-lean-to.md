This morning was a classic "always the last one out of camp", hostel edition. I missed the first shuttle after breakfast. Poet said he might be able to make a second run if there was some interest, and I was too busy playing the hostel piano that when he finally said he was making the second run, I scrambled to get ready. I had planned to get some cash from the ATM in preparation for Baxter, but Bonk said he could spot me.

Poet has got his shuttle run speech down pat, like a good city bus tour guide. "And if you look to your left, you'll see the largest waterfall on the AT." "Is it taller than Amicalola Falls?" "Well no, but WATER GOOD. VERY PRETTY. YOU SAY AHH." Entertaining, informative, guaranteed to get you excited for all of the remaining miles.

I had planned to keep my phone turned off for big chunks of the 100 mile wilderness, and I almost immediately regretted it- it's so pretty! I turned my phone back on for a few spots including a cool waterfall, but (I'm sorry Poet) I have no idea if it's the same waterfall Poet was pointing out from the car.
