I had a bit of a hard time enjoying myself today. I'm still a little anxious from yesterday, and I didn't sleep terribly well right next to the road. At least I started with a nice breakfast. Early in the morning, there was a really nice pond, and part of me wanted to stay forever, and an anxious part of me wanted to *go*. I stopped at a waterfall, and found the girl I had hiked over Killington with, having a town day with her boyfriend. (Us thru hikers, still out on the trail even on town days.) I took a photo of them together on her camera, and she took a photo of me on mine, and I was on my way again.

At a road crossing, I came up on Kachow, Live Mas, Brightside, and Grave Digger as they were taking a break. I basically walked with them for most of the day after that. It's weird - I remember coming out of Pearisburg, we stayed at a shelter with a tramily that basically made fun of these guys for being in denial of their tramily-hood. Now, they're a solid unit, and while I don't know if I ever felt like I was "inside" the circle with these guys, I feel a bit more outside now. I've made a lot of my own choices on trail, and I think those choices added up together mean that I'll probably never have a tramily on the AT. I guess that's ok.
