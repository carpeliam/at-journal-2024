Oh man, I learned a lesson today. I left Boots Off around 10:30am (because it's only a chill 16 miles to Iron Mountain) and, about an hour later, arrive at this dam. On FarOut, the dam has an icon that says it's a dependable water source, but the comments seem to indicate that FarOut is just trolling and there's no place for actual hikers to get water. I didn't fill up this morning before leaving the hostel because there's *always* water along the AT. Until now, and it's hot out, and super exposed. I haven't had to think about long water carries since my very first day, but today I had to ration water and it was not fun. For a while now I've been able to improvise about a lot of things, but I need to be smarter and more intentional about water. I spent about 20 minutes at the spring just drinking and filtering/refilling.

It took my body a bit to chill itself out, but I made it to the shelter by 5pm. And who did I see there, but Brightside and Kyler! (And then Liberty!) Except that Kyler is now Grave Digger. Brightside and Grave Digger (but not Liberty) are planning on doing the marathon tomorrow too, and the lot of us take up the shelter space (Liberty is tenting because he doesn't need to be woken up so early thank you), and talk about what time we plan to get up in the morning. Noah's planning on leaving around 4:30am or so, while Brightside and Grave Digger might do a 5:45am departure. I'm not especially good at getting out of camp in the morning, we'll see what happens. I'm a little anxious, but pretty excited.
