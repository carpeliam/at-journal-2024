Today was a tiring but good day. I had lunch at Dismal Falls, and landed at Woods Hole in the afternoon. All of our tents are set up in a nice little row. I'm starting to see some flowering buds on bushes, I think this is mountain laurel? And now [Mountain Laurel Designs](https://mountainlaureldesigns.com/) makes sense to me. I also saw a whole dear family just before Woods Hole. Given that I only saw one dear before stepping foot in Virginia, it's pretty easy to say that I saw more dear today than all previous days on trail combined.

Woods Hole is just a great place, favorite hostel along the trail hands down. The woman who runs it strikes a slightly hippy but very homey vibe, and it just works really well. Really relaxing. And the food was so good! Less showy than Mountain Harbour, but made with more love, if that makes any sense. I ate so much food today, I pooped twice. We played Codenames tonight, my first time playing Codenames in person since before the pandemic. Somehow I came from behind to win, I guess my Codenames shit talking skills haven't worn off too much.

I'm glad I was able to call my mom today for Mother's Day. We did a FaceTime Audio call, which somehow works better than a phone call given the signal. I won't be able to send her the alpaca socks until tomorrow. I wish I could have made the day better for her, but I think the only way I could do that would be to be back home in MA instead of out here on the AT in the first place. I hope she's not too anxious about me being out here.
