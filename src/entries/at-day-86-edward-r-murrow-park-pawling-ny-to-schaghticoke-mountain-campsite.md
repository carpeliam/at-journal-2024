Good bye New York! Hello Connecticut (and then hello NY but then hello again CT)!

I started the day off with (hooray) another deli. I made sure to order breakfast and to pack out dinner. The trail today was pretty, both in NY and CT! The trail in every state seems to have a personality, and CT feels a little like glamping, like the trail comes with all the amenities. The rocks have been rounded off, but with a hint still that you're outdoors and that you're roughing it. I dunno. The only hard part of the day (and it was a good little challenge) was Schaghticoke Mountain, which was the section of trail that dipped back into NY. We'll see, maybe CT will have some more hardships up its sleeve around the next bend.

It's really crazy though to be hiking *from Georgia* into a state that I've always come to in a car. I don't even know how it's going to feel when I hit Massachusetts. I've always felt like I have this home town advantage, where, from here, I get to hike through MA (my home), VT (my birthplace and home of the LT), NH (where I've done most of my hiking), and ME (where I've only hiked one mountain, I think? but it was Katahdin and I've done it at least twice).

I don't mean to complain that the trail in Connecticut is a bit more well-to-do than other parts. Hell, I wish northern PA had this kind of budget. One particular benefit I like is that CT has bear boxes and privies at campsites in addition to shelters. Tonight, I stayed at a nice campground, and there was only other couple that came in, the nice couple doing a section that I met last night in Pawling.
