SLEEP ACQUIRED. There was a tiny mishap last night as some dude arrived to camp after dark and set up at the same tent platform I was at, but I was able to get back to sleep, and I slept so well. Which led to a good day of hiking!

I hit my first NH trail magic spot at Crawford Notch, though the dude giving it out was a bit hard to peg. I introduced myself as Marathon, and he replied that this was a "trail name-free zone"; *ok, I guess you just won't know who I am, I guess*. But the homemade stew was very welcomed, and I appreciated him coming out.

The climb after Carter Notch was cool! I had some good views looking out over Carter Notch, and it's always so cool to see the road I had just crossed a few hours before.

I stopped at Mitzpah Hut for lunch, and made it to Lake of the Clouds Hut by around ~3:15pm. I asked about Work For Stay, and they told me to ask again in a few hours; Java (who I had met at Garfield Ridge campsite) had booked me a spot in the dungeon, but I was able to get that changed to WFS when the spots opened up.

Work For Stay was a bit weird. It's supposed to be only for thru hikers, but I think that the other hikers doing WFS were only overnight hikers. Also, there was a number of hikers that paid the $10 for a spot in the dungeon, but were allowed to sleep on the dining room floor instead, so the floor was a bit crowded. There wasn't much in the way of dinner leftovers either, maybe because of people coming out for tomorrow's Seek the Peak fundraiser, so I didn't get a big dinner. But altogether the experience of doing WFS was cool, and the barter mentality sits well with me.

It didn't sit well for everybody. The guys hiking with Beat Box are a group of southern boys, and NH is rubbing them the wrong way. I got into a slightly heated debate with a dude about the AMC, who doesn't believe he should ever have to pay to camp on federally protected land, but I think they're probably also running up against some good old fashioned New England style classicism. On one hand, I think they're absolutely justified to feel the way they feel, and it sucks; on the other, I think they're passing judgment on a section of the trail that they don't understand. I remember writing off the Smokies as "thanks for the $40, here's your tarp" but I think there's something dangerous about this tourist mentality of a thru hiker, walking through cultures without being part of them. I remember Live Mas defending the Smokies with historical context, I wonder if he felt at all defensive like I did tonight?
