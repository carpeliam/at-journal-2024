It took me 2 days last year to get as far as I got today. At my first shelter last year, I remember hearing AT thru hikers talking about hiking 20+ mile days, and here I am, just doing it.

This morning was a little disgusting. It started raining just as I was putting away my tent, and it was coming down pretty hard by the time I left camp. There was a bad weather bypass on the first climb, and I considered it for a moment, but pressed on. It calmed down a bit by the time I hit the Vermont border, enough for me to grab a snack and enjoy a break. Strong memories of the last time I was here!

I have a new friend: the little stuffed animal that came with the lollipop fits nicely on my pack, and I've decided to give him a trail name. His tag says "Bucky", but henceforth he shall be known as Snitches, given his stitches. He was pretty brave through the rain this morning!

It cleared up in the middle of the day, and I grabbed some lunch at the same shelter where I finished the day last year. I passed some LT hikers doing their first or second day, on top of Harmon Hill. I didn't know what to say to them; I wanted to say "you're in for such a wild ride, I'm so excited for you, you have no idea who I am etc" but all I could say was good luck. That's probably all that needs saying.

Shortly after crossing Rt 9, I noticed that one of my trekking pole tips came loose, so I finished the day with a single trekking pole. I think I should be able to get that solved in Manchester Center. The clouds came back shortly after, just as I took a breather at Melville Nauheim. Somehow, Smokey, a guy I had lunch with just once at my first shelter in NJ, recognized me. Small trail! I couldn't help but say, that was the third time I've ever visited Melville Nauheim, and it's rained each time.

The rain let up for a bit and I was able to press on to Goddard Shelter, even if it felt like I was playing chicken with the storm clouds toward the end. I picked a tent spot right next to where I was last year.

It's a bit surreal, revisiting all these spots again. It's good to be back in Vermont!
