Today I woke with the sunrise, and saw the sun peaking through the translucent dyneema sides of my tent. I'm slowly getting better at waking up earlier, though I'm not getting any better really at getting out of my quilt. I just lay there and contemplate, or procrastinate, or both.

Today marked another milestone: my first resupply! I heard conflicting reports from Bullfrog about when the shuttle from Dick's Creek leaves for Hiawassee, so I aimed for the most aggressive time frame (1pm) and beat it slightly only to wait an hour for the shuttle. A little while after I arrived, a white minivan pulled in, and a woman reported quietly that she was offering trail magic. In her trunk, she had just about everything you could ask for. I scored a banana, an orange, and some gatorade, though I could have gone back for more. A little while later, the shuttle pulled up. The shuttle had a hiker box in the back, and the driver (who had retired a few years back and was now driving this shuttle a few days a week just to be a good guy) offered up anything and everything inside of it. I scored a zip-lock baggie of freeze-dried strawberries, partly because I think I can use the baggie.

He dropped us off at Ingles, a grocery chain, in Hiawassee. I quietly discovered that Ingles is pronounced like Shingles, not like In-Glace as if it were Spanish. Outside of the supermarket, on the town square, there indeed was a hiker feed, put on by the mayor! Score one for the AT Guide. The potato salad was delicious.

Ingles had everything I needed, and while I sat at the in-store Starbucks repacking my bear canister, another hiker stopped and chatted with me a bit. She asked me if I had seen the eclipse today, but I figured it wouldn't be an attraction this far away from its path. Apparently, she said, it was still somewhat visible, and she gave me her pair of eclipse sunglasses, my best trail magic yet. Sure enough, I could still see a little bit of the moon covering the sun.

While I hung out in Ingles, charging my powerbank, I was able to catch up with Elizabeth, a friend from my Monday night get-togethers! She lives pretty far from the trail, but just so happened to be driving through the area, so it was serendipitous. We didn't have time to do much else other than chat, as my shuttle was headed back to the trail shortly, but it was good to catch up.

It's supposed to rain tomorrow. Normally I might stay in a shelter, but not during this noro outbreak. I'm a little nervous about tenting, but I need to get used to taking down camp in the rain. Fingers crossed.
