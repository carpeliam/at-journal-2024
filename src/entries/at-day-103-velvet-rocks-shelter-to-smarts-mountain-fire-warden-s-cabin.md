20 miles in NH! Smarts Mountain had a false summit or two, and it might not be 4000 feet but it definitely made me work for it. It definitely feels like I'm in NH, and from the top of the fire tower here, I could see Moosilauke in the distance. I can't believe I'll be in the Whites in the next few days.

I was going back and forth on where to land for the night, but I'm feeling pretty good about staying here. I was able to see the sun set from the fire tower, and I'm planning to see the sunrise in the morning. Also, the shelter has a closed door, so I should be mosquito free.
