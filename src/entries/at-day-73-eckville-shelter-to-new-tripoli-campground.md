Met up with 2pak in the morning while I was still getting ready to leave Eckville. He had camped at Pinnacle, and made it to Eckville before I had left. We talked about doing slow miles, and made plans to have a late lunch at Thunderhead at 4pm. He then caught up to me at the first vista (Dan's pulpit), and we chilled for a bit. I was only going 2mph, so I let him go first. A half mile later, a day hiker going SOBO said there's trail magic at the road crossing 5 miles up. This must have given me a mission, because all of the sudden I kick it into high gear, and rocks mean nothing to me now. I catch up to 2pak at 3mph and set pace to trail magic, which sadly had already left. Plan C however becomes to wait for Thunderhead to open from the hostel just down the road, so we do laundry and shower there. I check my weight on the scale: 138.5, I've somehow *gained* a bit of weight! But then the storm comes, so we wait out the rain with some Chinese food delivery with Dax and Grit. It's alright, I think 2pak didn't want to be seen with me, given I was wearing the most outrageous loaner clothes I could find. After completely filling up (2 pints of chocolate milk too?), I head to the camp site, with clean clothes and completely avoid getting wet from the storm. Sometimes Plan C is the best plan.

The camp site was a bit dodgy. It wasn't really clear if any of it was really made for tenting or not; there was broken glass around the spot I found. Baby Kong and I both made the best of it with our tent setups, and 2pak was just fine in a hammock.

It turns out that I won't be able to meet up with Teresa and Carter in NY after all. Trail logistics are hard.
