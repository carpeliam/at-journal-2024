Met up with 2pak in the morning- he had camped at Pinnacle, and made it to Eckville before I had left. We
talked about doing slow miles, and made plans to have a late lunch at Thunderhead at 4pm. He then caught up
to me at the first vista (Dan s pulpit), and we chilled for a bit. I was only going 2mph, so I let him go first. A half
mile later, a day hiker going sobo said there s trail magic at the road crossing 5 miles up. This must have given
me a mission, because all of the sudden I kick it into high gear, and rocks mean nothing to me now. I catch up to
2pak at 3mph and set pace to trail magic, which sadly had already left. Plan C however becomes to wait for
Thunderhead to open from the hostel just down the road, so we do laundry and shower there. But then the
storm comes, so we wait out the rain with some Chinese food delivery with Dax and Grit. After completely filling
up (2 pints of chocolate milk too?), I head to the camp site, with clean clothes and completely avoid getting wet
from the storm. Sometimes Plan C is the best plan.
