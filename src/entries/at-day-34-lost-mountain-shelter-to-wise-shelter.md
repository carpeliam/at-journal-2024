I was let go from my job today. It was awesome.

About an hour into hiking with Rabbit and Noah, I see that I've got a text from work, and it's not just anyone from work, but the head of my department, asking if I can chat. I usually keep my phone in airplane mode, but I'll take it out of airplane mode sometimes when I take photos and I want them to have location information. I had 2 bars, which is about as good as I ever have in the woods, so we tried calling.

Maybe a bit of background. I've been at the same company for close to 9 years, but it's gone through some changes, including an IPO and being acquired twice. They were cool enough about letting me take 90 days of personal leave to start the hike, but I wasn't sure myself whether I'd be coming back. With the most recent acquisition, our little division of the company was getting restructured, and a number of people were let go, but I came through unscathed. It turns out that I made it past the first round or so, but I didn't make it past them all. Ultimately, this is really good for me: it frees me up to finish the hike without having to worry about employment, and I think it comes with a severance package as well, which helps offset the cost of everything. This is maybe the best possible scenario for me, given that I'm out here caring more about being out on the trail than being gainfully employed.

After the call, I caught up with Rabbit and Noah, and we celebrated. Hooray, I lost my job! I'm free!

Today was the Grayson Highlands. All I knew about the Grayson Highlands is that they were maybe a little similar to the Roan Highlands, and that they had ponies. Both of these things turned out to be mostly true. Noah was happy to seek out the ponies and pet them, but I'm a rule follower so I didn't touch the ponies. I'd like to think though that, if they had asked to be touched, I'd enjoy petting them.

We also passed Mount Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia! I remember, just a few days ago, I could barely make out this mountain off in the distance, somewhere north. Now it's to my south. Sometime after Rogers, we noticed that we had crossed the 500 mile mark without even noticing. We didn't want to walk a mile back just to find it, so we created our own "501" mile marker. It was the prettiest milestone marker ever, with some nice serifs and everything. We left it there in the hopes that someone else would get a sliver of the amount of joy that we got from it.
