New York has been more of a challenge than expected so far. Tall, unkempt grass coupled with scrambling. I actually like it - it's like the ground is preparing to be New Hampshire - but I think it threw the Colonel for a loop. And today was just slow.

I had a good morning in Warwick with Colonel and Baby Kong, getting some more town calories at the bagel place. After the shuttle back, we got a late start around 12:30pm. By the late afternoon, when we were still a little ways out from the shelter, I made a soft proposal of looking for a spot to stop before the shelter, but it's tough to see what our options are. We didn't get in until around sunset, and I didn't have enough energy to set up my tent. Bugs, do with me what you will, let's see what you got.

Today's trail feature was the Lemon Squeezer. With a name like that, we were thinking it was going to be a slow slog, but I found it to be really fun! It reminded me of Fat Man's Misery in Purgatory Chasm.
