The flowers are starting to come out! The trail is littered with them. No megafauna though. I passed 3 shelters today. I stopped at Derrick Knob for a short lunch when I saw Brightside and Kyler chilling by the fire pit. Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT, is tomorrow. They're planning to get to Double Spring Gap Shelter tonight; the 15 mile plan I've been loosely following has me staying at Siler's Bald Shelter, but Double Spring Gap is just 1.7 more miles, which feels really doable. Besides, I already stayed at Siler Bald Shelter, staying at *Siler's Bald* as well would just be confusing.

A guy with a trail name of Tarzan came to our shelter tonight and started making steaks in the fire ring. I'm not sure if the wind picked up or if it got dark or what, but he moved it into the fireplace. The shelter has a stone fireplace built into the shelter itself, but I'm not sure how smart it is to be broadcasting the smell of meat to any bears in the neighborhood. I'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be a thing? I think Kyler recorded it on video. Nobody knew how long the meat had been sitting in his pack either. He also had chicken, that he was keeping cool by storing it in the water supply (in plastic packaging)? He said he was hiking the IAT (International AT), which I think extends to Florida and Newfoundland (at least, on this continent) - he credits a high meat and fish oil diet. I guess diet is highly personal, which is fine, but when he started burning the trash ("I know it's bad but it's better than leaving it for the bears") and leaving leftover tinfoil in the stove for others to clean up, I was frustrated. I take my own personal approach to [LNT](https://lnt.org) somewhat seriously, but I never know how to deal with others. "Hike Your Own Hike", of course, but is there a line? Last week at Siler Bald, Storm left a cantaloupe on the table, and I asked her if she could take care of it, she said she had finished with it, and it wasn't her responsibility anymore. When I left the next morning, it was in the middle of the trail. I guess it's better to let things go than to try to teach a stranger a lesson about the environment, but I wish I knew how to let the thought wash over me when the moment to let go has come and gone.

Mosey, who I met originally on day 1, has already hiked the AT, and the PCT, and is just spending time on the trail right now to build up her trail legs for the CDT later this summer. I asked her about some of the upcoming spots, and she steered me away from staying at Standing Bear, a popular hostel and where the first FarOut map of the AT comes to an end. This is a little bit of a bummer, as I already have a mail drop on its way to Standing Bear, but I can still pay $5 to pick it up without staying, and they never got back to me when I texted them the other day about renting a bunk. I thought Standing Bear was another iconic spot along the trail, and the sense I get from Mosey is that it is, but just not the vibe that I'd really be into.

We were all talking about going to Clingmans Dome tomorrow, and the weather is supposed to be pretty meh - I think I offered up the idea of a sunrise hike as a terrible idea joke, but everybody ran with it, and now we're all getting up super early tomorrow so we can hike in the dark so we can get to Clingmans Dome before sunrise.
