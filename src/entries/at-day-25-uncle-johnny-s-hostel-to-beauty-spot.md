If anybody ever tries to convince me that sleeping in a bunk is more of a vacation than sleeping in a tent, I'll remember this moment. I think the dude on the bunk directly below me has sleep apnea. I slept terribly. And the bed wasn't that comfortable. And I paid more money for the privilege. Next time, I'm taking the tent, even if it's wet outside.

Uncle Johnny's has bikes for rent, and I went for a ride with Fire Magic and Live Mas to resupply, get coffee, and visit McD's. It reminded me that not all bikes fit all people, and I think Fire Magic did the best job finding a bike that fits her, while Live Mas' bike was practically a low rider. After getting back to Uncle Johnny's and repacking my bag, I finally left the hostel at 3pm.

The last time I left this late in the day, it was 7 miles uphill out of the NOC. And honestly, when I got to the first shelter some 4.5 miles in, I thought I might stop there for the day. But then when I arrived, I chatted with some section hikers that had planned to finish the day at Beauty Spot, another 6.5 miles in. I had read about Beauty Spot! I had even saved an article to my phone that said, if you're going to camp anywhere on the AT, make sure to stop at Beauty Spot, where you can see both a great sunset and sunrise from your tent. I grabbed some water, and did some quick mental calculations, but that took too long so I just started walking and ran the numbers while on foot. It was 4:45pm, which left me relatively 3 hours or so to make 6.5 miles. And how many people might be there? It was a Saturday night, and the article said that this was a popular spot with the locals. I'd have to get there with enough time to find a good tent spot and get dinner before settling down to watch the sunset.

As I started the last climb, I could feel the wind howling around me. How exposed was this spot? Would it be like this at the top too? I made it to the summit before 7pm, almost perfect timing, and I was surprised to see only 2 or 3 other tents there. Rereading the FarOut comments, it seemed as though maybe Beauty Spot used to be a spot where you could order delivery pizza, but now the roads here were closed. Sorry, locals! It was still windy, but one of the other tenters told me that, if I camp right next to a certain fire ring, the wind was significantly dampened by some trees. And so I set up tent where they mentioned, and enjoyed one of my finer ramen noodle packets under a beautiful sunset. I thought about the definition of luck. Before getting on trail, luck was when preparation meets opportunity, but now that I'm out here and I've prepared as much as I can, luck to me is an awareness of those opportunities and the flexibility to meet them. I was tired when I got to the shelter today, but as soon as I heard the section hikers talking about Beauty Spot, I wasn't so set in stopping there that I couldn't pivot. And the views here were absolutely worth it.
