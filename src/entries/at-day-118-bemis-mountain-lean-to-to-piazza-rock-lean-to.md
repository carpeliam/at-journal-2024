We got an even better glimpse of those water features from yesterday. Maine is beautiful!

Bonk, Rabbit and I were chilling by an overlook, and a minute or so after Bonk pushed on, some guy (Sir Stops a Lot, amazing trail angel name) stopped and asked Rabbit and I if we wanted any trail magic. *Did we want any trail magic.* Heck yeah! He was a delight.
