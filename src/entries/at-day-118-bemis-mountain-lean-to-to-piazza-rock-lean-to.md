We got an even better glimpse of those water features from yesterday. Maine is beautiful! Bonk, Rabbit and I were chilling by an overlook, and a minute or so after Bonk pushed on, some guy (Sir Stops a Lot, amazing trail angel name) stopped and asked Rabbit and I if we wanted any trail magic. *Did we want any trail magic.* Heck yeah! He was a delight. We felt bad though for Bonk, who had missed out by only a minute or so.

Today was mostly just a day chillin' with Rabbit, taking in amazing sights, and catching up on old times.

In trying to find the shelter tonight, we accidentally took a side trail that led to the eponymous Piazza Rock. It's a big rock! Hopefully we can do some more exploring tomorrow. We met a southbounder in the shelter tonight who is carrying a bird. I don't know the full story, but the sense I get is that this stopped being about a thru hike at some point and became a "go on an adventure with my bird friend who I will take care of" hike. Also there are two privies for the price of one at this shelter?! I'm too lazy to check it out, but it sounds amazing. Two privies, four walls, one really open friend.

My sleeping pad developed a leak - I don't know when it first happened, but at least since I've been in Maine, I've had to wake up during the middle of the night to put air back in. It's getting worse. I'm close-ish to the end, so I might just see it through? but hopefully I can see about fixing it, maybe when I get to Shaw's.
