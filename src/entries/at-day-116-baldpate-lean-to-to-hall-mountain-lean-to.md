I saw a moose today!

The Baldpates were really nice, and *unbelievably* steep in places. I've grown a little accustomed to judging how long it will take to hike to a place on the horizon, based on how far away it looks; I vastly overshot the amount of time it would take to get from Baldpate West Peak to the taller Baldpate East Peak, largely because the trail just goes straight down and straight up. None of this switchback crap, I just walked down one mountain and up another in less than 30 minutes. To be honest though, I could deal with a little bit less adrenaline and a few more switchbacks.

One thing I'm definitely appreciating though is how Maine tends the trail. I didn't really have much of an understanding of different trail maintenance organizations before coming out on the AT. I realized a few things though while being out here: northern PA sucked, Bear Mountain in NY shouldn't have replaced a mountain with a set of stairs, and now, the Maine Appalachian Trail Club is finding a balance between kindness and ruggedness. I always thought I appreciated the "natural" ascents and descents of VT and NH, where a hill will have rocks arranged as if they had naturally been deposited there by a glacier thousands of years ago, at just the right distance away from each other. Maine has some places where the rocks are clearly placed by human hands, not by Mother Nature. But they're definitely not the same hands that put all those steps on Bear Mountain. I don't feel coddled by the trail like I sometimes felt in Connecticut. Instead, it's rugged as fuck, but with a heart. Somehow, also, the trail manages to be a story teller of where you're going, and the possibilities of where you could go. In Vermont, I could stand on Abraham and look south and see where I came from, and look north and see where I was headed, partly because the Green Mountains hug the ridgeline and there were few options to begin with. In Vermont, it was the mountains that told me where to go, but in Maine, it's the trail. Coming down Baldpate, I could see the mountains laid out before me; I knew my future. I'm kind of in love, I'm definitely in awe.

Coming down toward Dunn Cascades, I heard a big animal lumber through the woods ahead of me, cross the trail, and stop. I could see it through the trees: it was a moose! I wasn't fast enough to get a picture of it, but it was very cool. He or she didn't stay very long, but just long enough.

I stopped at Hall Mountain Lean-to around 4pm. I could have kept going to the tent site a little further up, but I'm planning to go into town tomorrow with Bonk and DK, and there's no need to walk further than we have to. Traveling with Bonk and DK has been pretty good -- we travel alone enough that I still get to Hike My Own Hike and see mooses and what not, but the group dynamic also reels me in.
