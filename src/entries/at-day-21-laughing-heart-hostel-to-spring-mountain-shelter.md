Of course I stopped by Artisun for a departing coffee/piano visit. Chris walked up as I was enjoying my drink, and we hung out a bit before I moved on - it turns out that Chris is a climber. He said he was meeting up with friends when he got to New Hampshire, so I told him to go visit Rumney. I wonder though, at least for myself, whether I'd have any arm strength by the time I get there. Town stops like this are great for calories, but I can feel my body redistributing itself as I spend more calories than I carry. I weighed myself at the hostel this morning: 146 pounds. I don't remember exactly how much I weighed before I left, but I'm going to guess I've lost maybe 5 pounds so far.

I crushed the ascent out of Hot Springs today! Along the sidewalk of Hot Springs itself are diamond-shaped AT markers embedded into the concrete sidewalk, but almost immediately after Artisun, over the bridge, the trail takes a hard right and hugs the river for a bit. And after a nice scenic river view, it goes *up*, and with a full stomach, I attacked it. After a few hours I caught up to Snail Mail and Fire Magic and we hiked together a bit, taking a little detour to check out a fire tower. Two for two on fire tower opportunities! This one was great, too - no rickety steps, and the top was enclosed and protected from the wind. We stayed up there for maybe an hour, looking out and chatting. A local Tennesseean came up for the view, and we chatted with him a bit. One thing I remember him saying, he mentioned seeing some hikers speeding down the trail, somewhat oblivious of their surroundings, and he couldn't understand why someone wouldn't slow down just a bit and enjoy the outdoors. I've been trying to strike a balance with nature the whole time I've been out here, and I told him that once you've been out here for a few months, the trees start to blend into each other. Sometimes the thing that's beautiful is not this particular tree in all its glory, but the comparison of these trees to those completely different trees you saw last week, some 100 miles back. He nodded as if to empathize, but I can tell he bears a strong preference for being able to appreciate the trees in front of him. Personally I wonder a bit if a thru hiker is cursed to lose the ability to enjoy the thing they came out here for, but so far I still feel like I'm net positive.

We got to the shelter by around 5pm. A few days ago, I covered 3 or 4 shelters in a day, and today, I took 2 days to get from one shelter to the next. It all comes out in the wash. Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and I found spots to pitch our tents and grabbed some dinner at the picnic table. Snail Mail got her trail name from the care packages she gets, as she's taken the mail drop option for resupply. Her family is doing a lot to personalize each drop, which sounds awesome. It'd be nice to hang out with this crew for a little while.
