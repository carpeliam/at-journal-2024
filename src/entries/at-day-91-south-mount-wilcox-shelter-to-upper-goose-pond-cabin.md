Last night I managed to get some sleep by covering myself completely with the quilt but carving out a little air hole to the side. I could hear the occasional buzz, but they were far less insidious than no-see-ums.

I'm on day 3 on my burgeoning relationship with the MA trail, and it continues to go really well. It's not at all very challenging (though I am looking forward to Greylock), but it's just really pretty, very giving.

I stopped at a little trail stand kiosk of sorts, a magical box marked "AT Trail Stand" that had snacks and drinks right next to a picnic table. And who do I see while stopping for a little snack lunch, but Brightside and Kachow! What's more, Live Mas is up ahead outside tonight's shelter, and is picking up McDonald's, and is willing to snag me something. Massachusetts, you're doing alright.

I hiked with them the rest of the way to the shelter, and this has to be the best shelter I've ever stayed in, ever. It's a cabin, with bunks upstairs, a little reading nook downstairs, and a caretaker who's going to make *pancakes* in the morning. Also, it's right next to a beautiful pond, with canoes and everything.

Massachusetts, you really are doing alright.
