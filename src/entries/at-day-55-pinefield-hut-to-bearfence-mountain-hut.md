Kicked off the day with another milestone, 900 miles! This is the last mile marker in triple digit country. I also think I saw a grouse on the trail this morning, going southbound? It looked well fed, and didn't stir at all as I passed. I'm guessing the animals in the park have plenty of food available.

I leapfrogged one hiker named No Plan a bit in the morning, and as we chatted a bit at a water source, it turns out that she's from Vermont. We ended up having lunch together and hiking together for most of the day, including stopping for snacks (ice cream, yogurt as a beverage, and a giant pickle, what choices) at Lewis Mountain Campground. The lady running the desk closed up while we were hanging out, but she said we could stay as long as we wanted. No Plan is doing big miles and so we probably won't overlap for long, but I think we might hang out for just a little bit longer and enjoy some more of these waysides.

The AT Guide plan recommended not resupplying too heavily in Waynesboro because there would be plenty of food inside the park, and now I see what it means. Every day affords at least one stop at a "wayside" which has plenty of snacks. Supposedly there's one or two that offer a blackberry milkshake, which I'm especially looking forward to. But I was pretty happy with my pickle in pickle juice electrolyte treat today.
