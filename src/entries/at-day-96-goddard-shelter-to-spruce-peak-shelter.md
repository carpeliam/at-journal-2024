I was amazed with how much less mud there is on trail vs. this part of the trail last year! It's been wet basically since I got to Vermont, and the section of trail right after the border is still pretty muddy, even if it's not quite the same obstacle course it felt like last year. But today, I went through my old friend, the Lye Brook Wilderness, and it was such a breeze.

Right before Lye Brook is Stratton, and I'm SO GLAD I got here on a good day. I finally had a chance to get views from the fire tower! I also managed to stop at Prospect Rock, a spot I had walked right by last year. In the spirit of taking the time, I went and checked it out, and I'm glad I did.

I finished today at Spruce Peak; for the second day in a row, I covered in one day what took me two days last year. Manchester Center tomorrow!
