I made it to Fontana Dam! And I got a trail name!!!

About an hour into the trail, I saw a big body of water barely visible through the trees, and as I descended the hill, it became clearer: this was Fontana Lake. Along the way, I saw purple flowers (an iris?) poking out of the ground - Spring was doing its thing! Most of Georgia was some form of monochromatic brown, and while the cooler temperatures have been great to hike through, I'm looking forward to a bit more color. I got to Fontana Dam Road just after 11am, where there was a tiny building with a set of bathroom stalls and a power outlet. I charged my electronics while I waited for a shuttle to bring me into Fontana Village, where I'd get my first mail drop.

Before I started the trail, I did a google search for "trail towns with the worst resupply", and Fontana Village came up high in the results. As the only resupply spot around before the Smokies, prices can get pretty high, and we're out of Ingles territory now. Having read about this ahead of time, I coordinated with family back home to send dehydrated meals, clif bars, and a Talenti jar (this was before I snagged some from Franklin) to the Fontana Village post office. The pickup process at the post office was smooth, and when I saw the prices in the general store, I was really happy with my decision to send food by mail! I bought the dehydrated food in bulk during a Black Friday sale, paying around $9/serving, and most of the meals in the general store were around $20. Even though it cost almost $20 to ship food from Boston, it was well worth it.

After I repacked my bag, I walked down to the Pit Stop, a gas station that also serves chili dogs, and grabbed some food. The guy who drove our shuttle (trail name of 'Shua, or Joshua) came in, grabbed a hot dog, and sat next to me, and we got talking. Toward the end, he asked me my name, and I gave my stock answer of "I don't have a trail name yet" \*hint hint\*, and this time, he suggested *Marathon*. Marathon? I asked - had I told him that I ran Boston during the pandemic year? I couldn't remember - and he replied about it being such an iconic piece of Boston. It was perfect, not because I had run Boston 4 years ago, but because I needed to remind myself that this was a marathon and not a sprint, because I had been pushing myself hard these past few days but I needed to remember to enjoy it, and not push my body to points of exhaustion like I felt I had done at times on the Long Trail.

One thing 'Shua said that stuck with me (and I don't remember the context, but it still stands alone):
> "We're all in the same boat, but there's a leak in one end, and we're just content to move over to the end that's sticking further up."
Dam(n), it's good to be out here.

A short while later, 'Shua drove me and the others back to Fontana Dam Road, and I hiked the 1.5 miles to my destination for the night, Fontana Dam Shelter. What a spot! Also known as the "Fontana Hilton", it had showers and an industrial-sized solar charging station. Pretty gorgeous views of the lake. And there was a good crew: Hitman, and Thomas and Kyler, and Terminator, and a whole bunch of people I hadn't met before but seemed awesome. Strider, who had started months before me and almost sheltered at my house in Boston before finding better accommodations, had arrived here as well, and he had great news: I hadn't been exposed to norovirus after all! Apparently, he was the author of the comment in FarOut about someone throwing up in the shelter at Wesser Bald, but he found out later that it was due to food poisoning. I was healthy after all! The Icelandic couple I had met in Franklin showed up, and apparently the guy had enjoyed a Wendy's experience so much, he acquired a trail name of Baconator. I met Live Mas, who was from the area and knew so much about the Smokies (and why we had to pay $40 to walk through it). Today was my first shower on the trail, and I needed it. I walked only 6 or 7 miles today, but today was a good day. We'll see what the Smokies brings.

I also had a chance to connect with Lorne from the Green Mountain Club about being a panelist for the Long Trail information session. He asked me a few questions, like when I hiked, and whether I had gone to college; I told him that one of the things I liked best about the Long Trail was how narrow the mountain range was, and how this made it very easy to see just where you were coming from (the easily visible mountain just south) and where you were going (the easily visible mountain just north). The mountains weren't just points on a map, but your past and your future. This was just maybe a better answer than "I enjoyed a mud hellscape, mostly without views. A++ type two fun, would maybe never do again." I told him I was excited to be on the panel, and while I was a bit concerned about logistics of finding internet along the trail, I was willing to try to make it work. He seemed game, so now I'm going to be talking to potential End-to-Enders in the beginning of May.
