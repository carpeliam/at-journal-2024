Today's the day that Gambit is headed to the brewery, so I'm back by myself again. I'm sure I'll see him again when I least expect it.

I made a detour today to Humpback Rocks. On one hand, it was a really cool view! On the other hand, it's getting hard to appreciate really cool views. Bright blue skies, long sweeping vistas, that's pretty much every day this month. It's frustrating because I *know* I'm looking at a beautiful view, it feels like it should evoke something, but all I can do is take a picture, sit down and stare for a minute or two, and get back to walking. Maybe this is the Virginia Blues. It's been a really pretty state so far, but the days blend into each other.

Rabbit texted me and Fluff to say she's coming back out onto the trail! I texted back a picture of the overlook. I told them about the privy at The Priest, too - better than all the privies in Tennessee combined, I said. Heheh. I have to imagine she'll probably catch up to me before I'm done, it'd be cool to hike somewhere in New England together or something.
