The trail provides! The trail provides! Just as I got to the road this morning where I'd have to turn off trail to do an unscheduled snack resupply, there was some trail magic! They had eggs and sausage, and one of them made me 3 peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, with a pro move of peanut butter on both slices of bread and the jelly in the middle, so that the jelly never leaked out. I was able to ride those snacks all day without even dipping into my own supply. I'll make it to Daleville without having to get off trail!

While yesterday was Dragon's Tooth, today I went through the other 2 parts of the Virginia Triple Crown, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. It was a pretty cloudy day so the views weren't great, but the trail was really easy going - you can tell which sections of trail are highly traveled by day hikers, when the trail starts getting exceptionally well groomed and well marked. I saw a lot of day hikers today, as well as day hikers who were hiking the VA Triple Crown.

I sat out the rain inside the shelter, and chatted with an ex-MIT professor as well as a guy who helped me identify different pine needles as well as sassafras trees. Good to move that tree identification goal along! I was pretty tired by the end of the day, so I tried to get some rest - but who should show up at the shelter, but Gambit? It's a small trail after all, and still I always see Gambit when I least expect to.
