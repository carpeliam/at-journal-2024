On one hand, I confirmed this morning that my bathtub is leaking, after last night's rain. I thought it might have a leak after the previous rainfall, but there were too many suspects then. On the bright side, I've identified the location of the leak, and sent off an email to Durston. We'll see what they say.

Before setting out, I spent the early morning grabbing breakfast and drying out my tent at the hut. I also spoke with the croo a bit, and learned (a) the croo at the first hut for NOBOs is apparently mean to *everybody*, not just the southern boys, and (b) the ascent up Wildcat has the steepest mile for northbounders anywhere on the AT. That was cool to learn.

At 10am, today was one of my later starts, but it was probably worth it to get breakfast and dry out a bit, and I don't think I would have gone any further had I started much earlier. Today was my last day in the Whites, and I *almost* made it through unscathed from wet weather. While last night was a proper hard rain, today was a classic New England rain, just wet all day long.

I passed Java and Stumbles going southbound on one of the Carters - they didn't want to go up Wildcat in wet weather (maybe they already knew how steep it was?). They were planning to make it to Carter Notch Hut, I hope they make it!

Tonight for dinner, I realized I had miscounted ramen packets during my hasty shopping trip to Walmart, and I ate a lonesome tuna packet for dinner. Definitely getting food in Gorham tomorrow.

Chappy, Red Maple, and Hawaii are back at the shelter tonight, and I can hear them from my tent. Definitely too high energy for me tonight.
