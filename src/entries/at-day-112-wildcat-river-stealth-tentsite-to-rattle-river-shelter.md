On one hand, I confirmed this morning that my bathtub is leaking, after last night's rain. On the other, I know
where it is, and emailed Durston. We ll see what they say.
Ate breakfast and dried my tent out at the hut this morning, and chatted with croo/SOBOs. One of my latest
starts, but it was probably worth it, and I don't think I would have gone any further had I started much earlier.
Passed Java and Stumbles going southbound on one of the Carters - they didn't want to go up Wildcat
(apparently the steepest mile on the trail) in wet weather. They were planning to make it to Carter Notch Hut,
hopefully they make it!
Miscounted ramen packets, ate tuna for dinner. Must get food tomorrow.

Chappy/Red Maple/Hawaii are too high energy for me tonight.
