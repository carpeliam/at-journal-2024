The blackberry milkshake is a thing! And I almost missed it. I had to backtrack when I realized that I had hiked a half mile past Big Meadows. I got there and met up again with No Plan, who had also hiked past the Wayside. I ordered pretty much *everything* off the menu, but I especially enjoyed a blackberry cobbler, even more than the blackberry milkshake. I'm really going to miss the ability to just buy calories in the middle of the day. I bought postcards to send back home too, hopefully they stay dry.

I got caught in a quick storm not far from the Byrds Nest #3 hut, and I was literally running down the trail trying to get there to escape the rain. By the time I got there, the storm had passed, and I spent a few minutes just drying out and eating a quick snack. After getting back on trail, I passed two other hikers who looked dry; I said that they had clearly done a better job avoiding the storm, and they replied, "what storm?" I guess these thunderstorms can get pretty localized.

I finally pulled into Pass Mountain hut a little on the late side, so I set up my tent and grabbed some food. No Plan and I ended up chatting for a while and I barely noticed as the sun went down around us. We grabbed a selfie (I still think back to Mosey saying that you'll want to capture yourself at moments along the trail) and called it a night.
