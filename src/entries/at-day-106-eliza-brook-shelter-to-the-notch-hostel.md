I kind of miscalculated how long it'd take to get to the pickup for the hostel. Chatting with some folks in the shelter last night, I  thought I might be able to make it to the 11am pickup, but that definitely didn't happen. Funny how I felt more anxiety this morning about getting out just after 7:30am than I felt in Georgia about getting started by 10am. But I've got a shuttle to catch, and the Kinsmans in between, so it's a bit more challenging.

The Kinsmans were a bit more challenging. There was one moment where, as I was stepping from one boulder to another, I realized I had stepped on one of my shoelaces; luckily, it came free before I lost my balance and fell off the boulder. I passed Chappy and friends at South Kinsman while they were taking a snack break. The peak was solidly in the clouds, but the clouds had moved on by the time I got to North Kinsman, and the views were really pretty. Definitely loving the Whites so far. I also got to my first hut, at Lonesome Lake; I don't know that I'll stay in one of these, but it was a nice stop along the way (they have baked goods! and soup!), and the lake itself was beautiful. There was a French-speaking family swimming in the lake that I'm guessing had decide to come to NH as tourists. Prettier than Boston, for sure!

I got to the Flume Gorge visitor center/parking lot by around 2:30pm, well in time for the 4:50pm pickup, but I couldn't pick up a signal in order to text them. Chappy and friends arrived a little bit after me, but they were planning to resupply and then get back out; they tried hitching, and while it's probably a challenging spot to hitch, it might be easier for 3 women than for me. I tried to hitch for all of a few minutes but decided it wasn't worth it.

Waffles and Hawkeye, a father/son duo who are vlogging their thru, arrived a little later, and with a little difficulty, we got a text through and arranged a pickup. Interestingly, the shuttle driver was a guy I recognized from some NH hiking facebook groups as a guy who does handstands on top of Washington more or less every day. Funny, I never gave much thought into how you could arrange that much time off and still get fed, but a shuttle driver job for a hostel in the middle of the Whites is probably a good way to do it.

Having learned from my bunk experience in Tennessee and my tent experience at the Inn at the Long Trail, I paid a bit extra for a private space, but I think I messed up. The space includes an upstairs loft area with beds, but it gets so hot up there that the hostel owner suggested sleeping in the downstairs area on a cot. I also had to spend time trying to dry out my tent, plus I still have plenty of nervous energy just floating about.

I really struggle with when to take a zero. I took one in Damascus, and I plan to take one at Shaw's in Maine, but my rubric right now for zeroing is basically, will the spot give me joy, with other people who give me joy? I don't know if this is the right way of looking at it, but I don't know anyone else at the hostel and this cot isn't giving me joy, so back on the trail tomorrow I go.

I didn't realize this when I booked the hostel, but this is the hostel where Meg participated in a panel talk on being a solo female thru hiker! There was a series of posters on the bathroom wall for fireside chats at the hostel, and hers was one of them. Pretty cool! I'm glad I was able to stay here.
