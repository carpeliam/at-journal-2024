Drive-in! Another state down!

I woke up "late", around 6:15 or so, and I wasn't sure if I'd make it to 11am shuttle pickup. Packed up super fast and headed out by 7:15. The first 3 miles were fast- I passed DK, and then Hero, but then the miles got hard. I was so soaked in sweat, I couldn't unlock my phone  as I couldn't dry my phone enough to press buttons. Kind of like the first rain when I crossed out of Georgia making it hard to grab a photo, but this time the rain was replaced with sweat, and I was under a deadline. Luckily, Hero came up on me a minute or so later and took of photo of me with the state line. With an hour left, thinking I had to get to 10.1, I had only gone 6.92, and the scrambles were not auto pilot-able. Luckily, around the 7 mile mark, the scrambles gave way to smooth ground, and I cruised, eventually catching up to Baby Kong and Colonel. We shuttled into town, set up tent at the drive in. I got lox and an iced coffee (with half & half!).

It's kind of cool that this drive-in lets hikers set up tents. We're basically behind all the cars, and we can see all 3 screens from here, so we get our choice of movie. They rent out hand-held radios so you can tune in. I'm going with Inside Out 2, largely because it's the first one and it'll have me in bed the earliest. It's funny how drive-ins by nature don't get started until after hiker midnight.

Before the movie I killed time either by chilling out or eating food or both. While I was chilling out in my tent, Live Mas arrived, and I caught up with him a bunch. Seems we've changed places a bit, where now he's doing big miles and I'm on vacation. It's cool.

The movie was fun. I've now seen more movies on trail than I've seen in much longer off trail, but hey, I'm on vacation! Hopefully tonight's rain will be more chill than last night's.
