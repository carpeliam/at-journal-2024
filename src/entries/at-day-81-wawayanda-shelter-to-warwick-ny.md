Drive in!
Woke up ‚Äúlate‚Äù around 6 15 or so, wasn t sure if I d make it to 11am shuttle pickup. Packed up super fast and
headed out by 7 15. First 3 miles were fast- passed DK, and then Hero, then the miles got hard. I was soaked in
sweat, Hero had to take my photo at the state line as I couldn t dry my phone enough to press buttons. With an
hour left, thinking I had to get to 10.1, I had only gone 6.92, and the scrambles were not auto pilot-able. Luckily,
around the 7 mile mark, the scrambles gave way to smooth ground, and I cruised, eventually catching up to
Baby Kong and Colonel. We shuttled into town, set up tent at the drive in. I got lox and an iced coffee (with half
& half).
Killed time either by chilling out or eating food or both.
Live Mas arrived, and I caught up with him a bunch. Seems we ve changed places a bit, where now he s doing
big miles and I m on vacation. It s cool.
Movie was Inside Out 2, and it was fun. I ve now seen more movies on trail than I ve seen in much longer off
trail, but hey, I m on vacation! Hopefully tonight s rain will be more chill than last night s.
