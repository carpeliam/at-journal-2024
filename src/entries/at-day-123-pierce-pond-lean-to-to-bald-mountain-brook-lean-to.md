Long day! Started with pancakes, then fording a river that came up to my shorts, then crossing the Kennebec.
DK and Bonk were in front of me, and I crossed with Bonk. Shortly thereafter, we got to the road for Carratunk,
and they got on the shuttle for Sterling along with Chappie & co., and I was alone to hike the next 12 miles, at
least until I caught up with Boone. We leapfrogged a bit as I kept pausing to reserve a spot at Shaw's, text mom
about mail drop, etc.
