Another Long day! It started with pancakes, and they were worth it. Tim, the guy running it, had a little keyboard, and he invited me to play -- I didn't even have to ask! I noodled a bit, and wound up making a little melody that stuck with me for a bit. While we were eating, Tim played a mix of covers and originals. He's got a cozy little spot here, and I think I respect him for doing what he can to hold on to it.

Almost immediately after pancakes, I got to ford my first Maine river! The water came up to my shorts, then crossing the Kennebec. In between fording and the Kennebec, I made a little ditty out of the melody from this morning: *"If you can't ford the river, wait for me by the shore / 'cause if you go and grow impatient, you might drown / I don't want to find your body at the bottom of the river / so if you can't ford the river, wait for me"*. Catching up to DK and Bonk by the river crossing, and I sang it to them. After a short wait while the ranger phoned in some info about a pack we had passed that was missing its owner, I crossed the river with Bonk. Another milestone in the books!

Shortly thereafter, we got to the road for Carratunk, and everyone else but me boarded the shuttle headed for Sterling along with Chappie & co., and I was alone to hike the next 12 miles, at least until I caught up with Boone. We leapfrogged a few times; every time I'd cross a clearing, I kept pausing to either reserve a spot at Shaw's, text my mom about mail drop, etc. Trail logistics continue to be a challenge. But it looks like everything that needs to be in motion is in motion!

I found a pretty good tent spot; Boone came in shortly after and ended up in the spot right next to me. A guy named Mouse is holding down the shelter all to himself -- he says he's an early riser, so I think a tent spot feels like a better bet tonight. Who knows, maybe I'll sleep well!
