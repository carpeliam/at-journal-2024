Out of all the days to get logistics right or wrong, I'm glad this day went well, as I got to hang out with my mom and my aunt today in North Adams.

North Adams is basically at the foot of Greylock, so it was fairly easy to get to. I just had to hike down the mountain, and there was even a trail magic cache in a public park right next to Route 2. It took next to no time to find a hitch into the center North Adams, as some nice section hikers were generous to give me a ride. I hung out at a local coffee shop (affogato secured!) and walked through a local bookstore until the afternoon, when my mom and my aunt were able to get into town.

Together we caught up over tacos and burritos, and I got to hear how the family is doing while I've been gone for the summer. (I asked how things have been going, given that I've been disconnected from the world; my mom started talking about current events in the news, and I interrupted to say, no, that's the part I wanted to ignore, tell me about the things happening to the people I love and care about.) After that, we walked through Big Y to get a resupply in, and pack out a deli sandwich for tonight's dinner. After resupplying, we did some gear swaps. It's finally time to retire the BeFree and give Sawyer Squeeze a try. My mom also got me a lollipop with a mouflon on top!

Finally, we drove back to the trailhead to say goodbye. After hugs and well-wishes, my mom got back into the car, and I saw her put her head in her hands and cry as I walked away. The whole time we hung out, it was just a normal day, no emotion on display, and I can only imagine that was my mom's intent, to make this a low-key fun day; the flip side of that is that I'm not really sure what emotions my mom is feeling, or has been feeling.

The hike out of North Adams was pretty straightforward, and it got me probably about as close if not closer to Vermont as where I was when I started the Long Trail last year. And in that last stretch, I passed another milestone of 1600 miles. Tomorrow morning, another milestone of getting into Vermont. It'll be kind of cool to chat with some end-to-enders.
