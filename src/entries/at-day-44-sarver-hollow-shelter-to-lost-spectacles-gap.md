If I ever do the AT again (unlikely), I should make sure not to go over Dragon's Tooth at the end of the day, having just hiked 20 miles. That was kind of stupid. I wanted to stay and get more out of it, climb around a bit, but I was pretty tired by the time I got there.

I passed over the Eastern Continental Divide today (I didn't know that was a thing), as well as a section that looks like it had recovered from a forest fire. I could smell it far before I could see it, so either it was kind of recent, or that acrid smell really sticks to the air. Maybe both.

And shortly before I got to Dragon's Tooth: 700 miles! This milestone was made out of sticks.

Dragon's Tooth looked like it shouldn't have been empty. There's no camping there, which makes sense? But without anybody there, it didn't look right, like an empty building. It didn't look natural, I'm not sure why.

I camped pretty shortly after Dragon's Tooth, at Lost Spectacles gap. There were some other tents already set up, I think from the other tramily that we met the other day after Pearisburg. I had dinner with one of them and chatted a bit, but when they all got in (including Fish Stick from the other day), I just stayed in my tent. I don't have enough energy right now for being social. I don't think I have enough snacks to get me to Daleville, so I've been rationing a bit, but there's supposed to be a spot tomorrow at the bottom of the hill maybe a half mile off trail that might have some food. We'll see what happens.
