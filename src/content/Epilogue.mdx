### Epilogue
I've been home from the trail for a little while now. In some ways, it was really easy to get back into the swing of city life, sometimes unsettlingly easy. Ted drove us in my car back to a local motel after we got off the mountain, but I drove us from Maine to Boston the next day. I hadn't driven in months, let alone a standard transmission, but I remembered every inch of how to drive like a Masshole.

Other parts of life proved harder to adapt. I miss waking and sleeping with the sun. It was a point of pride on the trail to not have to rely on an alarm clock as a general rule, and now I have to keep my blinds closed so that the street lights don't keep me up. Adapting to 3 square meals a day has taken time, and I've struggled with the lack of a constant flow of endorphins. I've had to watch my body become less efficient, and there's nothing I can do about it, realistically.

At some point, I finished reading *[The Comfort Crisis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55120630-the-comfort-crisis)*, Rabbit's book recommendation in which Michael Easter goes on a [misogi](https://www.twopct.com/p/whats-your-misogi) and comes back a better person. But he says that, eventually, the effects wear off, and he gets used to the comfortable life again. Being comfortable with being uncomfortable is not a "one and done" action; I'll have to work at it continuously.

Some people have asked me, *"how was it?"* and I have no idea how to answer that question. There are so many different dimensions, and each one of them was rich and complicated. I could speak for a long time on any part of it.

Others have asked me, *"would I do it again?"* and this is easier to answer, at least in the short term. If I were to go back in time, I'd absolutely do it again, and again, and again. It was the right thing to do at the right time, and I'm absolutely glad I made an opportunity to do it. But would I hike the Appalachian Trail, or another similar trail, now? Again? After having hiked it already? I'm not sure. I struggled with being a tourist, I struggled with days running into each other.

What I think this means for me, at least right now, is more smaller hikes, in the timespan of weeks instead of months. Just long enough to take me out of my element, but not so long that I get complacent, or start picking my nose in front of dayhikers. And I've built up a list of potential future thrus, from the [John Muir Trail](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/john-muir-trail/) to the [Superior Hiking Trail](https://superiorhiking.org/) to the [Colorado Trail](https://coloradotrail.org/) to the [Maah Daah Hey Trail](https://mdhta.com/) and more. In keeping with the Robert Frost theme, I still have miles to go before I sleep.

I want to acknowledge all the people that helped me take the roughly 5,000,000 steps from Georgia to Maine. From the thru hikers I met along the way, to the trail angels that gave me a ride or some food, to the family members who held things together at home and mailed me whatever I needed as I needed it, to the friends and family that checked in occasionally to see how I was doing, and last but not least the friends and family who came out to visit me at points along the way. I couldn't have taken the steps without all of your support.

Finally, thanks for reading. While I wrote this largely for myself as an exercise in reflection, I hope you got something out of this as well, either as an inspiration or as an insight into life on the trail. Please feel free to reach out to me if there's anything you'd like to chat about!
