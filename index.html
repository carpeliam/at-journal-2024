Day #1 on the AT! It was enough just getting here — I took the train down the previous night (yes, the <a href="https://youtu.be/A0F9lh8TiSM?si=WNNgeRtjFpZy0PGU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midnight Train to Georgia</a>), paying a bit more for a fold-out bed but not like it was easy to fall asleep anyway. On the ride down, I was massaging my foot, dealing with some muscle tightness from an impromptu run the day before. Well, however ready my body is or isn’t, I’m here.</p>
<p>The train pulled in about 30 minutes late into Gainesville GA but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063487306565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron</a> my shuttle driver made it work. On the ride there, Ron quizzed his three passengers on preparedness: did we know about the norovirus outbreak? did we know about long water carries? how much water were we carrying? In almost every fact that Ron talked about, there was at least one kernel I wasn’t already aware of. One of the other passengers had attempted the AT last year, and made it nearly a week before stopping; she knew her knees wouldn’t see her to Katahdin, but she just wanted to get farther this year than she did last year. The other passenger was carrying a portable CPAP machine to manage his sleep apnea. And here I was with a 40L pack, thankful that the electronics portion of my base weight was so much more manageable.</p>
<p>Ron dropped us off at the Amicalola Falls Visitor Center, where I was just in time to sign in, get my hang tag, weigh my pack, and attend a short slideshow lecture on the Georgia part of the trail. One thing that stuck with me was the advice to only hike around 8 miles each day in the first few days, even if my lungs and muscles were fine with more, due to the time it takes for ligaments/tendons to warm up. It sounded like good advice, and I plan at least to not totally ignore it. I took one last photo of a sheet marked “GEORGIA SHUTTLE DRIVERS”, made sure I had everything, and walked on out, as the next wave of arrivers was getting started with the same slideshow lecture. It was 10am by this time, and I needed to get this party started if I wanted to make some miles and get to camp at a decent hour.</p>
<p>Just as I was walking out, I saw Haroula, a fellow Bostonian whose sister was apparently starting the trail on the same day as me. Haroula’s whole family had come down to see her sister off. Haroula called out to me as I left the visitor center, and I told her about my eventful train ride down. She told me her sister had started an hour ago, but was planning to camp at the same shelter I was. I was excited to come into the trail already “knowing” someone, even if I only actually knew her sister, and not even that well.</p>
<p>The beginning of the approach trail was a bunch of stairs. There was some renovation going on, so the normal path up the “Stairs of Death” (a respected rite of passage) was inaccessible; in their stead were an equally grueling set of stairs. But once I got up, there was still a beautiful sight to take in: the tallest waterfall in the state of Georgia.</p>
<p>The top of Amicalola Falls was approximately 1 mile into my day, but I still had another 7 miles to get to the top of Springer Mountain where the trail actually began, and then another 3 miles to get to my shelter destination of Stover Creek. The hike up was pretty manageable, and the wooded summit still gave a good view on the mountains Somewhere Out There. But now I’m actually on the trail. The one with the white blazes. While chilling out at the summit, I met Brad, from Florida. Brad was also thru hiking, but his parents had come up to Springer to hike with him on his first day. I chatted with them a bit about the excitement, nerves, and expectations, but soon I said goodbye and gave them the mountain to themselves.</p>
<p>I finished up at Stover Creek Shelter around 3:30pm, leaving me a few hours before sunset to set up my tent and get dinner. I found a cozy piece of ground outside the shelter to make food; norovirus stuck around on surfaces for periods of up to 2 weeks or so, which made the shelters themselves somewhat off limits. While I ate, I chatted with someone who turned out to be Dema, Haroula’s sister. A little while later, Thomas and Kyler came over and hung out, and we all chatted about expectations. Thomas had hiked as far as Virginia a few years back, and that opened up more questions. What were the Smokies like? How were resupplies? But we also all wondered, how big was the thru-hiker turnout this year? How big would the bubble be? As much as I want to let the trail wash over me, I also want to get past the bubble. It seems like a lot of hikers signed up to start in March, and given that no one is staying in the shelters, the tent sites will likely be packed.</p>
<p>It was pretty cold and windy by the end of the night, down to around 38º, and the next few nights are supposed to be colder. I guess I’ll learn all about what Georgia mountains are like in Spring.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-04">AT Day 2: Stover Creek Shelter to Gooch Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/4/2024</div><div>12.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>2.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->15.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="58/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="2/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>It was cold, waking up. As I lay under my quilt, I could already hear the other tents around me, packing up and chatting to each other quietly. Two people accidentally kicked one of my tent stakes — either camp is crowded, or I need to do a better job pounding stakes into the ground, or both.</p>
<p>I got out of camp kind of late (after 9am?). After about 2.5 miles in, I saw Forklift (who I met in passing yesterday) and her friend Mosey, stopped at a waterfall. I wasn’t going to say no to new opportunities, and I walked the 0.2 miles down a side trail to get a view of the falls. I was impressed that Forklift and Mosey already had trail names on just Day 2 — apparently they had met while hiking the PCT. The falls was nice — two waterfalls in two days! — and I wonder a bit if every day will have a little side quest just like this. Mosey offered to take a picture of me with the falls, but I declined; I didn’t want to make my journey about me, and I didn’t want to stop observing. But Mosey said from experience that one of the biggest mistakes one could make was to not get pictures of themselves along the way, to see how they changed from start to finish. I’ll have to keep that in mind, how I can capture my own change without being a tourist of the trail.</p>
<p>Damn, does Sassafras Mountain have steep grade. 🥵</p>
<p>Before I started the trail, I planned to use the AT Guide <a href="https://www.theatguide.com/12-milesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 mile</a>/<a href="https://www.theatguide.com/15-milesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 mile</a> plans as a baseline for where I might want to stop for the night, given no other factors. But those plans assume you’re starting from mile 0 at the summit of Springer Mountain, whereas I started some 8 miles before then, so I subtracted a little from the plan in order to make similar miles. About 11 miles from Stover Creek is Devil’s Kitchen, which has spots for 8 tents. But when I got there, it … didn’t look appetizing. It just didn’t feel right. And there were some guys taking a water break at the creek right before it, and they were planning on moving on. So I decided to let momentum take me another mile and a half to Gooch Mountain Shelter.</p>
<p>Gooch Mountain Shelter seems like it’s well organized out of necessity. As you enter the grounds, there’s a map of where all the campsites are, and signs saying that each dirt tent pad should have two tents. I went off to start setting up on an empty dirt pad, wondering who my neighbor for the night might be, as the campground would certainly fill up. Shortly after I finished setting up, Clark and his daughter Olivia rolled in. Olivia was planning to do a large section of the AT (maybe the whole thing), while her dad was planning on hiking with her for just the first week before returning home. When I told Olivia that I was from Boston, she said that she was planning to move to the area after college, but she wasn’t sure yet exactly what she hoped to find there — with a background in music and english, I told her I’d connect her with my friend who teaches in Mass. There was just enough signal to send a text out. Clark offered me the use of his sit pad when he noticed I didn’t have my own, and I was just about to graciously accept when I took my hand away at the last moment. He must have been confused until I explained to him about the norovirus outbreak, and we weren’t supposed to touch other people’s stuff. I think he was grateful that I told him, as he said he didn’t know — they both seem nice. I really like how the trail kind of comes with its own in-built community, and Clark and Olivia and I can all kind of interact as friends, making connections and offering sit pads and sleeping within 5 feet of each other, without ever seeing each other before today.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-05">AT Day 3: Gooch Mountain Shelter to Bull Gap</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/5/2024</div><div>16.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>15.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->32.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="50/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>I woke up to the sound of Clark and Olivia chatting and making plans. It turns out, Olivia came down with norovirus and started presenting symptoms this morning. I guess symptoms show up around 12 hours after contracting the virus, so I’m really glad now that I didn’t borrow that sit pad from Clark. Their plan of hiking for a week through Georgia has been cut short, and now their new plan is to get off trail as soon as possible. I gave them the photo of all the Georgia shuttle drivers, and told them that my shuttle driver Ron was great, but I guess Ron has a full plate and won’t be able to get them out until this afternoon. I made oatmeal and coffee, partly as a means to boil the water I had in yet another attempt to keep norovirus at bay, and chatted with them while they planned. This morning was an even later start to my hike than yesterday, not leaving camp until around 9:45. More or less everybody had cleared out before me.</p>
<p>Today’s hike included Blood Mountain, the high point of the Georgia section. Ron had made it sound like a challenge, but it didn’t seem very strenuous. All around the mountain are these little clusters of short trees, I don’t know what they are — I want to call them olive gardens, because that’d be hilarious, even though they’re definitely not olive trees. At the base of the mountain is Neels Gap (or Neel Gap, depending on who you talk to or which sign you read); after the arches and steps and waterfall of Amicalola and the summit of Springer Mountain on Day 1, this was my first AT landmark, home of the iconic <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-appalachian-trail-shoe-tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoe tree</a>. It’s also the first spot along the trail that sells pizza. They sell frozen pizza, but they’ll microwave it <em>for free</em>. What a country. I bought a ton of other snacks including a tuna packet, chocolate milk, some iced tea, a lighter and some hand sanitizer, and I think they conned me into buying an extra fuel canister unnecessarily.</p>
<p>While I ate my pizza, I chatted with Dema and Forklift. Looking at FarOut, the ubiquitous trail smartphone app, the next shelter was Vogel State Park, though they charged $25 for tent sites, which didn’t sound great. But Dema and Forklift said that just a mile up the trail was Bull Gap, a tent-only campsite that had room for plenty of tents. This sounded great, as I hadn’t even considered staying outside of the grounds of a shelter.</p>
<p>I got to Bull Gap and set up my tent, but I don’t think I did a great job. This is my first trekking pole tent, and while it looks easy on YouTube, it’s definitely not easy for me. Even when I feel like I’m doing it somewhat efficiently, it still takes probably twice as long as those practiced YouTubers. And the tent I have (a Durston XMid Pro) is a pretty popular tent — I wonder if I’ll see anyone else with it and be able to grab some pointers. After setting up for the night, I had my first opportunity to cross another milestone off my list: I dug my first cat hole. I’ve now officially pooped in the woods.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-06">AT Day 4: Bull Gap to Low Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/6/2024</div><div>10.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>32.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->43<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="40/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>Last night was super windy. I really do need to get better at putting my tent up: there was so much slack that each gust was pushing the tent wall into my face. I didn’t sleep super well, my watch gave me a sleep score of 40/100. To be fair, it hasn’t given a dramatically higher score to any of the other previous nights, but I’ve got a lot of adrenaline. I’m going to have to learn how to chill out.</p>
<p>Another milestone today: my first trail magic! Technically, I was offered trail magic on my first day, but it felt weird being offered a candy bar on my first day out, so I declined. Today however, I rolled up to Hogpen Gap, and there after the road crossing was a super nice dude with a pop-up canopy, a wide selection of snacks, a charging station for electronics, a good number of chairs, a hand washing station, and—the grand finale—homemade veggie stew. This was not this dude’s first rodeo. I took some stew (he did all the serving, following proper norovirus protocols), as well as a kiwi, a brownie, and a mini-cinnamon bun. And then I pushed on.</p>
<p>At camp tonight at Low Gap Shelter, I met Sink, as well as Tom, a stout 50+ guy from Connecticut. Tom was the first New Englander I’ve met on trail, and we chatted about the Whites. I told him I had read in the AT Guide about a hiker feed in Hiawassee with the mayor on Mondays, and we planned to lay up at Unicoi Gap (~10 miles up) tomorrow and head into Hiawassee the next day.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-07">AT Day 5: Low Gap Shelter to Tray Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/7/2024</div><div>15.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>43<!-- --> to <!-- -->58.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="61/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="let your body recover">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>I caught up to Tom on trail, and we took a break together, trying to figure out (with 1 bar of cell service) whether the hiker feed was on Mondays as reported by the AT Guide, or whether it was on Wednesdays and Thursdays as indicated by some comments in FarOut. Some time later, I realized that my 15 mile plan had me arriving at Hiawassee from Dick’s Creek instead of Unicoi Gap, and Sink told me that it was supposed to rain on Tuesday, with thunderstorms on Thursday. I made a game time decision to stretch for Dick’s Creek Gap tomorrow, and told Sink to tell Tom that I’d try to meet him there.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve been able to hike virtually all day without sweating, as the southern latitude of Georgia pairs nicely with the early April weather, but I can feel it starting to heat up and I don’t know if I’m going to like it! Unicoi Gap had more trail magic (I’m getting spoiled and I won’t complain); I got myself a hotdog and some chocolate milk. The woman running the stand said that Dema and Forklift passed through just a few hours before. She also has a penchant for giving out some epic trail names: earlier today, when one hiker was excited about a particularly large burl protruding from a tree, she dubbed him <em>Fat Bottomed Burl</em>. I met him and his hiking partner Chicken Little at an overlook just a few hours later.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-08">AT Day 6: Tray Mountain Shelter to Plum Orchard Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/8/2024</div><div>15.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>58.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->73.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="70/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="let your body recover">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today I woke with the sunrise, and saw the sun peaking through the translucent dyneema sides of my tent. I’m slowly getting better at waking up earlier, though I’m not getting any better really at getting out of my quilt. I just lay there and contemplate, or procrastinate, or both.</p>
<p>Today marked another milestone: my first resupply! I heard conflicting reports from Bullfrog about when the shuttle from Dick’s Creek leaves for Hiawassee, so I aimed for the most aggressive time frame (1pm) and beat it slightly only to wait an hour for the shuttle. A little while after I arrived, a white minivan pulled in, and a woman reported quietly that she was offering trail magic. In her trunk, she had just about everything you could ask for. I scored a banana, an orange, and some gatorade, though I could have gone back for more. A little while later, the shuttle pulled up. The shuttle had a hiker box in the back, and the driver (who had retired a few years back and was now driving this shuttle a few days a week just to be a good guy) offered up anything and everything inside of it. I scored a zip-lock baggie of freeze-dried strawberries, partly because I think I can use the baggie.</p>
<p>He dropped us off at Ingles, a grocery chain, in Hiawassee. I quietly discovered that Ingles is pronounced like Shingles, not like In-Glace as if it were Spanish. Outside of the supermarket, on the town square, there indeed was a hiker feed, put on by the mayor! Score one for the AT Guide. The potato salad was delicious.</p>
<p>Ingles had everything I needed, and while I sat at the in-store Starbucks repacking my bear canister, another hiker stopped and chatted with me a bit. She asked me if I had seen the eclipse today, but I figured it wouldn’t be an attraction this far away from its path. Apparently, she said, it was still somewhat visible, and she gave me her pair of eclipse sunglasses, my best trail magic yet. Sure enough, I could still see a little bit of the moon covering the sun.</p>
<p>While I hung out in Ingles, charging my powerbank, I was able to catch up with Elizabeth, a friend from my Monday night get-togethers! She lives pretty far from the trail, but just so happened to be driving through the area, so it was serendipitous. We didn’t have time to do much else other than chat, as my shuttle was headed back to the trail shortly, but it was good to catch up.</p>
<p>It’s supposed to rain tomorrow. Normally I might stay in a shelter, but not during this noro outbreak. I’m a little nervous about tenting, but I need to get used to taking down camp in the rain. Fingers crossed.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-09">AT Day 7: Plum Orchard Gap Shelter to Standing Indian Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/9/2024</div><div>12.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>73.9<!-- --> to <!-- -->86.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="58/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="10/100">🥵</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today was the first rainy day on the trail, <em>and</em> I crossed a state line! Another few milestones. As I was figuring out the best way to pack up my wet tent (solution: the same as normal, except wetter), I found a tent stake in the mud left over at the tent closest to mine. Some guys waiting out the rain by the shelter said she left just a little bit before me, so I did the best I could to catch up — but I didn’t get a tenth of the mile up the trail before realizing I had left my inReach satellite device back at the tent site. I definitely can’t be losing things like that, not this early! I ended up catching up to the tent stake’s proper owner about 4 miles in, just before we got to the Georgia/North Carolina state border. We both spent a few minutes desperately trying to unlock our phones to in order to take a photo, but it was so wet that the touch screen wasn’t registering my finger very well. Finally, I got mine open, and we both took a photo with the sign. I’ll have to send her photo when I get into town. Right after the border was this really cool tree that I’ve seen pictures of in other peoples’ journals, but I didn’t realize that it was in this part of the trail! Even though it was wet, it was exciting to cross into North Carolina, and none of the mud here is anything like what I saw in Vermont last year.</p>
<p>I met Austin, and we were both thinking of heading to Standing Indian Shelter tonight. I got there a little bit before him, and started chatting to the two guys in the shelter, telling them that I was planning to tent (my tent was already wet), but Austin was planning to stay in the shelter with them. One of the guys started saying that Austin better not keep his food in the shelter, because he’s not going to be a party to some bear coming in and ruining the place. He went on for a little while about other people not appreciating bear safety, without any prompt from me. The guy just seemed irritated about just about everything. Somehow he found his way to complaining about how the White Mountains were not nearly as grandiose as everyone made them out to be. His friend, on the other hand, was a gentle soul, but also in rough shape — he was upset with his pants, but felt compelled to wear them because his wife had gifted them to him and he didn’t want to let her down. When Austin arrived a little while later, the first guy was still getting upset about everything, and Austin looked at me so as to say, “are you getting a weird vibe from him too?” And I gave him back a look that said, yep, I’m getting the same vibe. I’m definitely tenting tonight, there’s too much weird energy going on with these two.</p>
<p>All of the shelters I stayed at in Georgia had bear boxes. Standing Indian has a strongly worded letter, stapled to a tree. “BEAR ALERT”. I’m pretty sure I’ll be fine given I have a bear canister, but the FarOut comments say there’s a problem bear in the area, and he can even crack a PCT bear hang. We’ll see what the morning brings.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-10">AT Day 8: Standing Indian Shelter to Long Branch Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/10/2024</div><div>16.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>86.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->102.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="48/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="7/100">🥵</abbr></div></div><div><p>I couldn’t sleep last night — I thought I could hear the bear taking down the bear bags! But when I woke up, everybody’s bear bag was unharmed. Well, there was one casualty, but it was from a mini-bear: I accidentally left the baggy of freeze-dried strawberries in the shoulder strap pocket of my pack (outside my tent, in the vestibule), and a mouse chewed through it and ate all the strawberries. I wasn’t too concerned about the strawberries, but I’m not crazy about the hole in the shoulder strap pocket. Oh well, I guess it needed to get “broken in”.</p>
<p>It was nice and cool and misty. I made really good miles today: I went over 3 mountains of ~5000 or taller, and passed maybe 3 or 4 people along the way. And today, I crossed the 100 mile mark! There was a little “100” etched into the blaze of a tree to mark the occasion. I’m pushing ahead of the 15 mile/day plan as I heard there might be a thunderstorm coming and I didn’t want to be on top of Albert Mountain (which has a very metal fire tower) in the middle of it. Luckily I made it to the shelter before the weather turned too badly. Given the impending weather though, I think tonight will be a stay-in-the-shelter night. Winds tonight are supposed to be super rough.</p>
<p>I was nervous that everybody else would have the same plan, and that it would be a tight squeeze at the shelter tonight (another reason to make good time so that I could get to the shelter early), but when I got there I realized I had nothing to worry about. This shelter is <em>huge</em>, with an upstairs loft. And everybody staying at the shelter is so cool. I introduced myself to one guy, and he looks at me straight-faced and says, “I’m dying.” His trail name was “Dying”. And his comedic delivery was perfect. I also played chess against Gambit (so named because he’s carrying a portable magnetic chess set) — it was a really close game, and I had a potentially winning position as black, but I was content to finish with a draw. When each hiker would walk up to the shelter out of the weather, we’d give them a cheer, and I did the same when Austin rolled in. Tomorrow is the Franklin NC, the second resupply, and it’d be cool to check out a trail town with this crew.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-11">AT Day 9: Long Branch Shelter to Siler Bald Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/11/2024</div><div>10.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>102.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->113.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="61/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on sleep quality">🥱</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="26/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>If it has to rain (and it does), it’s good to happen on a town day. Franklin has a shuttle system just like Hiawassee, and picks up at both Rock Gap and Winding Stair Gap, which is 3 or 4 miles further down the trail. Winding Stair would be the ideal spot given that it would put us back on trail with fewer miles to walk, but we weren’t sure if we could make it there before the 9:30am shuttle, so sure enough I found some of my shelter mates huddled under a tree at Rock Gap. I came up singing “Singing in the Rain”, just enjoying the weather. As the shuttle pulled up, we waited for people to get off first before we got on; I guess the stairs were super slippery, as someone almost completely wiped out. In Franklin, I snagged some more food from Ingles (this one a slightly smaller and more limited than the Hiawassee location, but they did have Southern Butter Pecan flavored Talenti), and then treated myself to some large frappuccino-like monstrosity at Brooklyn Bagels. While I was inside, the sky opened up and it rained hard, but then stopped again just when it was time to leave. I don’t think I understand southern weather patterns just yet. I brought my sandwich and frappe back to the gazebo and found a place to charge my phone, having an early lunch with some of other hikers I met on the sidewalk today.</p>
<p>My original plan was to enjoy town, maybe hang out with some of the peeps from the shelter last night, but after a few hours passed and I had already accomplished my town chores (food to pack out, food to wolf down), I decided to jump on the 12pm shuttle back to Rock Gap. Kind of a bummer, because around an hour later, I finally got a text from Dying about meeting up at 5:30pm.</p>
<p>As I was getting off the shuttle, I saw that guy from Standing Indian who had made such a fuss about bear safety. (Austin told me later that, while he spent a good 40 minutes looking for a good branch to hang his food, Fussbucket—not a real trail name—hung his from the weakest branch just a few feet off the ground.) I was so fixed on making eye contact with him that I missed my footing and slipped down the shuttle stairs in the same way that this morning’s hikers had. “Careful,” said Fussbucket in a manner that in no way communicated any concern for my safety, and I picked myself up and walked past him, back to the trail. Not 5 minutes later, after the shuttle departed with Fussbucket on his way into town, his friend (the kind one of the two) showed up, out of breath, wondering if I had seen his friend. I had to inform him that he had just left a few minutes before — turns out that this guy busted his butt to make the shuttle, and Fussbucket couldn’t be bothered to wait 5 minutes. And technically, this guy was on time, as the shuttle left some 3 minutes early. Poor guy.</p>
<p>Speaking of Austin. This morning was maybe the last time I’ll see him, and I didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye. He’s an ex-Marine whose wife died of breast cancer just a short while before he came out on the trail- it was kind of the forcing factor for him to come out here at all. He had already booked an Alaskan cruise some time later this summer with his dad, so I’m not sure if I’ll see him again. He continued on this morning to meet his dad at Winding Stair Gap, and now he could be anywhere.</p>
<p>The weather continued to hedge between being rainy and stormy, until finally it decided to really storm. The wind was whipping at my shell, and I just focused on keeping my head down and moving forward. Whereas last night’s shelter was large and sturdy, tonight’s shelter was packed like sardines. Storm volunteered for everyone to make space for me, but I could tell I wasn’t going to fit and so I waited for a break in the rain to set up my tent. And now I’m writing this while it’s thundering and lightning-ing; I thought this spot might be well protected from the wind, but my little tent is still getting hammered. This is definitely the first “Type 2 fun” day. Sometimes I can’t believe I’m actually out here on the trail — I’m maybe a bit worried that it won’t sink in until I’m done. I write this with only a thin layer of dyneema protecting me from a thunderstorm. There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>I noticed today that the trail in these parts is cut into the side of the incline. This is maybe an act of kindness,
so you don’t have to go over the top of the hill directly, but it feels unnatural- I remember “On Trails” which
talks about the evolution of trails where iterations find easier, more straightforward paths. This on the other
hand feels very intentional, which it is. Is intentional the same thing as unnatural? Maybe not, but it feels more
akin to the product of western thinking than to my ancient forefathers.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-12">AT Day 10: Siler Bald Shelter to Wesser Bald Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/12/2024</div><div>17.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>113.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->131.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="54/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="8/100">🥵</abbr></div></div><div><p>Yesterday, I thought I might never see Austin again. I ran into him this morning, on top of Siler Bald. The trail is weird.</p>
<p>I got a super late start this morning, setting out at a whopping 10am. I really need to get better at getting up and out earlier. Storm was the only one still in the shelter, huddled invisible underneath a sleeping bag. The blue blaze out of shelter was rock and mud and a bit annoying to navigate, but once the path crossed the AT and headed straight up to Siler Bald, it got a bit easier, if you don’t mind steep. I saw two guys take their packs off to lighten their load as they walked up the hill, but I made a point (for no good reason at all) of trying to catch up to them while wearing mine. I did not expect one of the guys to be Austin. Austin introduced me to Siesta, who he had met hiking out of Winding Stair Gap yesterday.</p>
<p>Side note: Siler Bald Shelter is connected to the AT via the Siler Bald Trail, looping in both directions. Don’t tell anyone, but instead of walking south on the Siler Bald Trail to reconnect to where I had left the AT, I walked north instead, and in doing so, missed about a half mile of the AT. Please don’t tell anyone.</p>
<p>The top of Wayah Bald seemed like a good lunch spot for Austin, Siesta, and me. It has a cool observation tower, you can see for miles. As we sat there on the north side of the tower to escape the wind, it started snowing — actually, it was sleet! And it was still super windy, so it was blowing everywhere, truly wild. Really fun to hike through, especially as it didn’t accumulate.</p>
<p>My original plan today was to stop at Cold Spring Shelter, but when I got there, I just didn’t like the vibe. As I refilled my water, Siesta caught up to me, and we chatted about where to end up. He was planning on pushing on to Wesser Bald Shelter, another 6 miles up trail, to put us in a good place to get to the NOC tomorrow and then the Smokies. That’d be a long day, but I felt that I could do it. And we did do it! Siesta’s fast, though. I feel like I’ve been able to offset my late morning starts by walking around 2.7 miles and hour, sometimes a bit more, but I’m barely keeping up with Siesta. It turns out he’s a true ultralight hiker: he doesn’t carry a power bank, he’s cold soaking his food, and he sleeps on a thin foam pad. Bad ass.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-13">AT Day 11: Wesser Bald Shelter to Sassafras Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/13/2024</div><div>12.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>131.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->144<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="49/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="17/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I got a little turned around this morning and couldn’t remember which way was north. I walked about a tenth of a mile in one direction before I ran into Chris, who I had met at the mayor’s hiker feed back in Hiawassee. My doubt about which direction I was going in made him doubt which direction he was going in! He was right and I was wrong, so I’m glad I found out then before getting too far.</p>
<p>This morning’s hike was really cool. Right after the shelter, the trail is on the ridgeline, but still mostly in the trees. And then, a switchback brings you out of the trees and gives you a view of the entire valley. It was an amazing view, up there with Franconia Ridge, and I’m bummed I didn’t get a picture (there was someone behind me).</p>
<p>At the base of Wesser Bald is another milestone, the Nantahala Outdoor Center or NOC. As soon as I get there, I see Hitman, who I met the other day at the same shelter as Storm. I told him I came from Wesser Bald Shelter, and he says, “Oh, the norovirus shelter?” Apparently someone had thrown up in the shelter a few days before, and that makes the four of us who stayed there exposed. Great.</p>
<p>The NOC seems mostly like a tourist spot for white water rafters and the like, but I was able to eat a full breakfast, get some laundry done, print out my Smokies permit, and charge my electronics. Austin showed up, and we hung out a bit — he was meeting someone to buy a tent replacement for the tarp system he was using. We grabbed a late lunch, but then it was time for me to move on, as the next shelter was 7 miles away, all up hill. I’ve been going faster than Austin the last few days and I get the sense that he wants me to slow down a bit and stay at a similar pace, but he’ll be off trail soon and I feel like I want to cover more ground. Technically there are some hotels or motels around here, but they cater to white water rafting tourists who are here to spend money, and that’s not what I’m looking for.</p>
<p>While I was charging my electronics, I checked my email and saw that I had a letter from the Green Mountain Club — they were looking for potential panelists to help give a zoom info session about their experiences on the Long Trail. I had seen an email in March about it and even started filling out an application, but stopped when I tried answering the question of what I would bring to the panel; <em>“Dear GMC, I would bring to the table the unique perspective of a white dude from Massachusetts. Please include me in your panel!”</em> But today, the GMC reached out to me specifically, noting that I had indicated after finishing the trail that I’d be excited about sharing my experiences, and asked if I’d be interested in discussing it. I let them know that, yes I’m interested, but given that I’m out here on the AT, that could either be a really interesting perspective or a really gnarly scheduling exercise. I guess we’ll see what happens.</p>
<p>I said a final goodbye as Austin’s tent connection showed up. It was getting on 3:30pm at this point, and I was doing some quick calculations. Sunset’s at 8pm, but tent spots fill up before then, and I’d have to beat 2 miles per hour just to make it before 7pm so that I wasn’t eating dinner in the dark. Normally I’ve been getting 2.7 or 2.8 miles per hour but not uphill. I finished right around 6pm, so I think that put me around 2.7 miles per hour, going up hill! And I saw my first snake on trail: it was a black snake, and I think we both gave each other a good scare. As I pulled into the shelter, I saw there weren’t many great tenting options, at least not this late, and I found a spot on the side of the hill that would do in a pinch.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-14">AT Day 12: Sassafras Gap Shelter to Cable Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/14/2024</div><div>15.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>144<!-- --> to <!-- -->159.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="55/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="29/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today started off really hard. Last night’s sleep was terrible. My knees and ankles are letting me know that they’re not happy about everything. I took a pee break at a view some 30 minutes into the day, and I don’t know if I ever recovered.</p>
<p>About 6.5 miles into the day, at Stecoah Gap, I arrived at a highway crossing, and there was another thru hiker chilling out, sitting at a picnic table and chatting on the phone. As I pulled up to a corner of the table and started in on a snack, a stranger walked up to me with a snack packet and offered it up as trail magic. Score! Yes sir, I’ll take some raisins, please and thank you.</p>
<p>I grabbed some lunch at Brown Fork shelter, and met Midnight Snack. He seemed to have pains of his own, but his disposition about it was something to aspire to. Hopefully I see more of him, but I’m afraid I won’t — I might finish this whole thing without establishing much of a tramily. When I went to the privy, I realized I had forgotten my poop kit back at the shelter, and I was too tired to walk back and fetch it, so I used leaves instead. I think they did the job.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-15">AT Day 13: Cable Gap Shelter to Fontana Dam Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/15/2024</div><div>6.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>159.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->166<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="56/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="35/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I made it to Fontana Dam! And I got a trail name!!!</p>
<p>About an hour into the trail, I saw a big body of water barely visible through the trees, and as I descended the hill, it became clearer: this was Fontana Lake. Along the way, I saw purple flowers (an iris?) poking out of the ground — Spring was doing its thing! Most of Georgia was some form of monochromatic brown, and while the cooler temperatures have been great to hike through, I’m looking forward to a bit more color. I got to Fontana Dam Road just after 11am, where there was a tiny building with a set of bathroom stalls and a power outlet. I charged my electronics while I waited for a shuttle to bring me into Fontana Village, where I’d get my first mail drop.</p>
<p>Before I started the trail, I did a google search for “trail towns with the worst resupply”, and Fontana Village came up high in the results. As the only resupply spot around before the Smokies, prices can get pretty high, and we’re out of Ingles territory now. Having read about this ahead of time, I coordinated with family back home to send dehydrated meals, clif bars, and a Talenti jar (this was before I snagged some from Franklin) to the Fontana Village post office. The pickup process at the post office was smooth, and when I saw the prices in the general store, I was really happy with my decision to send food by mail! I bought the dehydrated food in bulk during a Black Friday sale, paying around $9/serving, and most of the meals in the general store were around $20. Even though it cost almost $20 to ship food from Boston, it was well worth it.</p>
<p>After I repacked my bag, I walked down to the Pit Stop, a gas station that also serves chili dogs, and grabbed some food. The guy who drove our shuttle (trail name of ‘Shua, or Joshua) came in, grabbed a hot dog, and sat next to me, and we got talking. Toward the end, he asked me my name, and I gave my stock answer of “I don’t have a trail name yet” *hint hint*, and this time, he suggested <em>Marathon</em>. Marathon? I asked—had I told him that I ran Boston during the pandemic year? I couldn’t remember—and he replied about it being such an iconic piece of Boston. It was perfect, not because I had run Boston 4 years ago, but because I needed to remind myself that this was a marathon and not a sprint, because I had been pushing myself hard these past few days but I needed to remember to enjoy it, and not push my body to points of exhaustion like I felt I had done at times on the Long Trail.</p>
<p>One thing ‘Shua said that stuck with me (and I don’t remember the context, but it still stands alone):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re all in the same boat, but there’s a leak in one end, and we’re just content to move over to the end that’s sticking further up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dam(n), it’s good to be out here.</p>
<p>A short while later, ‘Shua drove me and the others back to Fontana Dam Road, and I hiked the 1.5 miles to my destination for the night, Fontana Dam Shelter. What a spot! Also known as the “Fontana Hilton”, it had showers and an industrial-sized solar charging station. Pretty gorgeous views of the lake. And there was a good crew: Hitman, and Thomas and Kyler, and Terminator, and a whole bunch of people I hadn’t met before but seemed awesome. Strider, who had started months before me and almost sheltered at my house in Boston before finding better accommodations, had arrived here as well, and he had great news: I hadn’t been exposed to norovirus after all! Apparently, he was the author of the comment in FarOut about someone throwing up in the shelter at Wesser Bald, but he found out later that it was due to food poisoning. I was healthy after all! The Icelandic couple I had met in Franklin showed up, and apparently the guy had enjoyed a Wendy’s experience so much, he acquired a trail name of Baconator. I met Live Mas, who was from the area and knew so much about the Smokies (and why we had to pay $40 to walk through it). Today was my first shower on the trail, and I needed it. I walked only 6 or 7 miles today, but today was a good day. We’ll see what the Smokies brings.</p>
<p>I also had a chance to connect with Lorne from the Green Mountain Club about being a panelist for the Long Trail information session. He asked me a few questions, like when I hiked, and whether I had gone to college; I told him that one of the things I liked best about the Long Trail was how narrow the mountain range was, and how this made it very easy to see just where you were coming from (the easily visible mountain just south) and where you were going (the easily visible mountain just north). The mountains weren’t just points on a map, but your past and your future. This was just maybe a better answer than “I enjoyed a mud hellscape, mostly without views. A++ type two fun, would maybe never do again.” I told him I was excited to be on the panel, and while I was a bit concerned about logistics of finding internet along the trail, I was willing to try to make it work. He seemed game, so now I’m going to be talking to potential End-to-Enders in the beginning of May.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-16">AT Day 14: Fontana Dam Shelter to Russell Field Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/16/2024</div><div>15.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>166<!-- --> to <!-- -->181.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="84/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take on the day">🤩</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="58/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>This morning’s walk was a pretty big departure from the last few weeks. Instead of walking in the mountains at around 4000 or 5000 feet above sea level, I walked over the dam today at around 1700 feet above sea level. Immediately following the dam, there were National Park Service signs for “Great Smoky Mountains National Park”, and shortly after that, the box to deposit the entry portion of my Smokies permit. The way the permit system works is, you print out your permit ahead of time, rip it in half, stick half of it in a box upon entering, and stick the other half in a box upon exiting. I’m not sure how often they collect the permits, but this morning the entry box was full.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure what to expect from hiking through a National Park — I kind of feel like it should be an even more pristine form of nature than I’ve been hiking through so far.</p>
<p>Today was my first chance to go up a fire tower on a clear day, and I took it. Two years ago, on an overnight hike in Vermont, I walked right by a fire tower on top of Stratton Mountain, and when I went up Stratton again while on the Long Trail this past year, it was socked in with no chance of views. It left an imprint that opportunities are finite and fleeting and unpredictable, and I resolved to climb every fire tower I could if it were a clear day. Shuckstack gave me my first choice, and while it didn’t disappoint, it was maybe a bit… too much. A few days ago, coming down into the NOC, the view unfolded and revealed itself like a story, but the view from Shuckstack was a bit like that at the Grand Canyon, where you’re presented with all of it all at once, with no build-up or release of dramatic tension. I’m not disappointed! just a bit overwhelmed. There’s just so much.</p>
<p>I saw Hitman having lunch at Mollies Ridge and stopped to grab a snack, but kept moving after a few minutes when I got sick of the flies surrounding the campfire pit. Just a few steps later, I saw my first deer! And, I saw a really colorful millipede this morning. Maybe hiking through a national park <em>will</em> show me an even more pristine form of nature than I’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>I got to Russell Field, my home for the night, and it was covered by a tarp. The same was true with Mollies Ridge shelter, I’m not sure what the deal is. To protect against bears? To protect from high winds at high elevation? Unknown. Some familiar faces were there, including Thomas (now known as Brightside?) and Kyler. Dema walked by, exclaiming “Hi Liam!”, and I shouted back, “It’s Marathon now!” I no longer answer to <em>“Liam”</em>. Forklift and Mosey were there too, and Forklift let me take some pictures of her tree identification book. Each page had a picture of leaf patterns, a picture of bark patterns, and paragraphs about identification and habitat. It’s been an objective of mine to learn how to identify trees while I’m out here, and now I’d be armed with real knowledge. At least, when it comes to distinguishing between different species of Oak.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-17">AT Day 15: Russell Field Shelter to Double Spring Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/17/2024</div><div>16.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>181.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->197.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="69/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="56/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>The flowers are starting to come out! The trail is littered with them. No megafauna though. I passed 3 shelters today. I stopped at Derrick Knob for a short lunch when I saw Brightside and Kyler chilling by the fire pit. Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT, is tomorrow. They’re planning to get to Double Spring Gap Shelter tonight; the 15 mile plan I’ve been loosely following has me staying at Siler’s Bald Shelter, but Double Spring Gap is just 1.7 more miles, which feels really doable. Besides, I already stayed at Siler Bald Shelter, staying at <em>Siler’s Bald</em> as well would just be confusing.</p>
<p>A guy with a trail name of Tarzan came to our shelter tonight and started making steaks in the fire ring. I’m not sure if the wind picked up or if it got dark or what, but he moved it into the fireplace. The shelter has a stone fireplace built into the shelter itself, but I’m not sure how smart it is to be broadcasting the smell of meat to any bears in the neighborhood. I’m pretty sure this isn’t supposed to be a thing? I think Kyler recorded it on video. Nobody knew how long the meat had been sitting in his pack either. He also had chicken, that he was keeping cool by storing it in the water supply (in plastic packaging)? He said he was hiking the IAT (International AT), which I think extends to Florida and Newfoundland (at least, on this continent) — he credits a high meat and fish oil diet. I guess diet is highly personal, which is fine, but when he started burning the trash (“I know it’s bad but it’s better than leaving it for the bears”) and leaving leftover tinfoil in the stove for others to clean up, I was frustrated. I take my own personal approach to <a href="https://lnt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LNT</a> somewhat seriously, but I never know how to deal with others. “Hike Your Own Hike”, of course, but is there a line? Last week at Siler Bald, Storm left a cantaloupe on the table, and I asked her if she could take care of it, she said she had finished with it, and it wasn’t her responsibility anymore. When I left the next morning, it was in the middle of the trail. I guess it’s better to let things go than to try to teach a stranger a lesson about the environment, but I wish I knew how to let the thought wash over me when the moment to let go has come and gone.</p>
<p>Mosey, who I met originally on day 1, has already hiked the AT, and the PCT, and is just spending time on the trail right now to build up her trail legs for the CDT later this summer. I asked her about some of the upcoming spots, and she steered me away from staying at Standing Bear, a popular hostel and where the first FarOut map of the AT comes to an end. This is a little bit of a bummer, as I already have a mail drop on its way to Standing Bear, but I can still pay $5 to pick it up without staying, and they never got back to me when I texted them the other day about renting a bunk. I thought Standing Bear was another iconic spot along the trail, and the sense I get from Mosey is that it is, but just not the vibe that I’d really be into.</p>
<p>We were all talking about going to Clingmans Dome tomorrow, and the weather is supposed to be pretty meh — I think I offered up the idea of a sunrise hike as a terrible idea joke, but everybody ran with it, and now we’re all getting up super early tomorrow so we can hike in the dark so we can get to Clingmans Dome before sunrise.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-18">AT Day 16: Double Spring Gap Shelter to Peck&#x27;s Corner Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/18/2024</div><div>21.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>197.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->218.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="50/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="listen to your body">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="34/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>We did it — we woke up far too early to hike 3 miles to the tallest point on the AT. And it wasn’t even that hard. The top of Clingmans Dome has a concrete observation tower, and we were there bright and early (with only a small crowd of people who were there before us, the Smokies are the most popular park in the country and this might be its most popular destination) to see the sun diffuse through heavy clouds. I heard later that the clouds melted off by 9am or so, and if we had just gotten up at a normal hour, we would have had a better view (not to mention a better sleep), but doing things reasonably is for suckers. If I wanted to do things reasonably, would I really be out here in the first place?</p>
<p>The observation tower in the books, we walked down the road toward the visitor center as everyone else is planning on doing some road miles. I misheard Brightside as having said there was a vending machine, and soon everyone in the group was full-on expecting it to exist. When we reached the visitor center and it wasn’t even open yet, I was only partly devastated. We had breakfast on the stone wall behind the parking lot bathrooms, and it was time to part ways, though I wasn’t nervous as I was pretty sure I’d see at least a few people later on today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>The rest of the morning was kind of beautiful, as I walked out of one forest and into another: somewhat dramatically, I stopped seeing trees of one type and started seeing trees of another. I really do need to get better at identifying trees, though I want to say I walked into a variety of pines. There was just enough mist and fog floating through the trees to give it an air of magic. There was also a literal fence enclosure, or exclosure: apparently, wild hogs had been decimating the beech population, so they created a fence to keep the hogs out, and it’s wild to see so many beech trees growing in such a small, specific slice of land.</p>
<p>When I got to Newfound Gap, I saw Hitman in a group trying to get a hitch to Gatlinburg — he was tired and wanted a break, but I selfishly was hoping just a bit not to lose people just yet. It was my own choice too, as they asked me if I wanted to come along, but I wanted to keep the inertia going. After they scored a ride a minute or two later, I sat down to trail magic and rested up just a bit.</p>
<p>Walking out of Newfound Gap, I spotted my first sign for Katahdin! I also spotted a noticeable difference in walking speed between me and the day hikers. Of course the one woman who was closest to keeping up with my speed was a retiree from Colorado, the state where outdoorsy people go to live outdoors.</p>
<p>Later on, I caught up with Chris, and I was relieved; I thought everyone I knew had left, and I was alone again on the AT. We met a friend of Tarzan’s chilling out at Icewater Shelter, who made an empathetic case for him. There’s always another side to someone, and one of Tarzan’s other sides is that he likes carrying things as ballast, including dog food. I don’t remember Tarzan’s friend’s name, but I do remember that her dog’s name was Cujo, and that Cujo scared away 3 bears at Russell Field shelter a few nights back.</p>
<p>Chris and I carried on. We checked out Charlies Bunion and took pictures, but soon I started to outpace him; there’s this constant battle in me between wanting to be social and make friends on trail, and wanting to burn miles, and I feel best about my body on trail when I’m pushing it forward. Today was my first day getting to 20 miles, and my legs and lungs were happy about it, though my feet were pretty tired. I got to Peck’s Corner ahead of Chris, and again I was a stranger to everyone in the shelter. Someone in the shelter had an equipment emergency, their hipbelt having attempted to run away from their pack, and I was able to lend them my sowing kit. I don’t even know how to use it myself (I’m convinced I could figure out if I had to), but I’m glad to see it’s going to good use. Chris showed up a little while later, and it was good to see a familiar face.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-19">AT Day 17: Peck&#x27;s Corner Shelter to Davenport Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/19/2024</div><div>19.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>218.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->238.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="73/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="listen to your body">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="48/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today was my last full day in the Smokies, and the first day of the trail that felt like a green tunnel! So much of the Smokies is high up (and Newfound Gap was at 5000 feet above sea level), but now that I’m coming down from elevation, the leaves are starting to appear.</p>
<p>I spent a significant amount of time trying to look for bears in trees, not because I was scared they might be there, but because I was sad I might make it through the Smokies without seeing one.</p>
<p>Pretty much every other shelter in the Smokies has come with a tarp to keep the outside out, but Davenport Gap Shelter has a gated chain link fence. Grampy Hippy, another thru hiker staying here for the night, said that all the Smokies shelters used to come with fences, until they started realizing that hikers were feeding the bears through the holes in the fence. Grampy Hippy is an interesting dude; well into his 70s, he’s actually finishing his Triple Crown, having completed the other two legs some 50 years ago. To have hiked the CDT in the 70s, when there was barely a paper map let alone a support network, is wild. Rounding out the crew in the Davenport jail was Tortoise (named so because of her poncho that covers her pack), Ray, and a guy section hiking north, about to enter the Smokies.</p>
<p>I really don’t understand the privy situation in Tennessee. The word is that none of the shelters in Tennessee have privies, and this is supposed to include shelters on the Tennessee side of the trail in the Smokies, although I can’t confirm if this is true or not. In any case, Davenport Gap doesn’t have a privy, but rather, a bathroom “area”. I feel bad for the women trying to find privacy behind a tree in the “bathroom area”. Really not sure what hiking through Tennessee will bring, but I’m glad that the trail doesn’t hang out for a while there.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-20">AT Day 18: Davenport Gap Shelter to Roaring Fork Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/20/2024</div><div>19.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>238.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->257.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="83/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take on the day">🤩</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="62/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I’m wearing a Garmin watch during the trail, and one of its features is to recommend a workout every morning based on my current training load. On my first morning on the trail, it said ooh, yesterday was a lot, and you should rest, and I ignored this. On my second morning on the trail, it said it didn’t know what the hell was going on but yesterday looked pretty tough, and I should rest. I didn’t rest. On the third day, rinse and repeat. Every morning since my first day, my watch has told me to stop hiking, enough is enough. UNTIL TODAY. Today, my watch said, hey, today looks like a good day to go for a walk. Ok, it didn’t phrase it like that, but we speak a language.</p>
<p><em>I think my watch just told me I’ve got my trail legs.</em></p>
<p>I left the Smokies this morning, stuffing the other half of my permit into a box just a mile into the day. Two miles later, I was picking up my mail drop from Standing Bear. Mosey was right, I don’t think this would have been a spot to stay the night, but they were kind enough to let me hang out and charge electronics for a solid two hours.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the day, I crossed Max Patch, and holy crap, what amazing views. The sun was out, and so were all the locals, including a couple doing their engagement photos. I bet local wedding photographers make bank. You’re not allowed to camp on Max Patch itself, and sadly, all the tent spots on the next hill over were all pretty full. It was 6:45pm when I rolled into Roaring Fork, and the shelter was full, but I snagged one of the last tent spots before heading back to the shelter’s picnic table to make my dinner.</p>
<p>Someone asked me where I was from, and when I said “Boston”, it turned out that there was another person in the shelter from Boston — and from Jamaica Plain, no less! This was total deja vu for me, after the same thing happened to me on the Long Trail. It turns out that Snail Mail lives in the Forest Hills area, which is only 2 T stops away from me. Also, it turns out that one of Snail Mail’s friends did the Long Trail the year before I did! And somehow remembers more of it than I did. I spent my whole dinner chatting about the LT, which at ~275 miles, is still the longest hike I’ve ever been on. But that might change any day now.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-21">AT Day 19: Roaring Fork Shelter to Deer Park Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/21/2024</div><div>14.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>257.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->272<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="59/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take on the day">🤩</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="50/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>My watch told me to rest again.

Fire is likely the first thing that mankind ever invented, and it’s still by far the most interesting one.</p>
<p>North Carolina privies were not built for people with normal dimensions. The only way to fit into this privy is to either cut off your knees (this seems suboptimal) or leaving the door slightly open. Also, the foundation didn’t seem super stable? 1.5/5 stars.</p>
<p>Oh hey, I finished today at mile 272 — that’s exactly as far as the Long Trail, depending on the year. As of tomorrow, this will be the longest hike I’ve ever been on.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-22">AT Day 20: Deer Park Mountain Shelter to Laughing Heart Hostel</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/22/2024</div><div>2.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>272<!-- --> to <!-- -->274.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Building">🏠</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="79/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take on the day">🤩</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="64/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>Those whippoorwills last night really were not excited about me getting any sleep. And again, I was the last one out of camp this morning. Not like I had far to go — it was almost exactly 3 miles downhill from Deer Park Shelter to Hot Springs NC, and I took more or less the whole thing at a trot, trending toward canter. I’ve discovered that different knees prefer different trail directions; one of my knees has a harder time with going uphill while the other one has a harder time going down. But I’ve discovered that, if I land with my forefoot, going downhill gets a bit easier. So I’ve adopted this gait sometimes where one foot lands on the forefoot while the other lands on the heel. Human bodies are weird, human bodies walking all day every day are weirder. Whatever works, works.</p>
<p>I had booked my own personal room at the hostel, and checked in around 9:30am. After I put my stuff down, I looked on the map for the nearest coffee shop. But not just any shop that sells coffee. During one town stop on the Long Trail, I bought myself an affogato, and it was <em>delicious</em>. The milkfat is also probably important too. So now when I’m in town, I search for the coffee shop that’s most likely to have an espresso machine, and hopefully some ice cream to go with it.</p>
<p>Hot Springs is a really lovely little trail town, with a main drag that runs for just a few blocks. Laughing Heart was at one end, and so I started out toward coffee, which I never drink while on the trail (it takes too much time and wastes a boil) but is a trail town staple for me. After walking just a block or so (the trail itself goes right down the main street!), I saw Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and Honeybuns walking toward me; they also had gotten their rooms settled, and were headed to the diner for breakfast. I planned to hit up the diner after, but I couldn’t pass up breakfast company, so I asked if I could join them, and we headed over to the Smoky Mountain Diner. After we had finished our breakfast but were still chatting, some friends of Fire Magic’s named Lost and Liberty came in and sat down with us. Lost was a tall and lanky Virginian, while Liberty resembled the me I’d aspire to in 10 years, albeit with a Scottish accent.</p>
<p>After breakfast was chore time. But first, fancy coffee. I walked the 0.3 miles to Artisun, and DID YOU KNOW THEY HAD A PIANO?! Holy crap. After accidentally finding a piano inside the Inn at the Long Trail, I had googled a few times about which hostels along the AT might have a piano, but came up dry. And here I was at a random coffee shop in North Carolina, and they had a piano. After getting my coffee, I asked the barista if I could borrow their piano, and they were happy to lend it. I spent a good chunk of time either playing old songs or just capturing the mood.</p>
<p>After a little while it was time to get some real chores done. I noticed this morning that my water bottle and filter was missing in action, so I looked into the Outfitter to see if they might carry the same one, but they didn’t have the bottle in the same size, so I bought a pair of trail gaiters instead. (I’ll always miss my Dirty Girl gaiters, and I’ll never forgive Topo for making a proprietary gaiter system. But here I am, giving it a shot.) I grabbed some mediocre food options from a picked-over Dollar General, and headed back to Laughing Heart to get some laundry done. Their loaner clothes were infinitely more interesting than the oversized tees of the Inn at the Long Trail, and I pared a camoflage henley with a pair of purple capri pants that fit perfectly; “the bottoms for when I want to be seen, and the top for when I don’t.”</p>
<p>Going back to search for my water filter would add 6 miles to my day, which was a bummer, but I’d have to do it. But while I was chatting with someone at the hostel about having lost it, the hostel’s caretaker overheard me and asked what kind it was — apparently, Numbers had seen my bottle along the trail and rescued it. The chances of someone else spotting it, deciding to pick it up, deciding to carry it north, and deciding to bring it to this hostel out of all places, must be pretty slim, but the trail does provide.</p>
<p>With time now left on the day, I headed back to Artisun to purchase a sugary excuse to sit down at the piano again. Honeybuns came in and saw me, and (unbeknownst to me in the moment) grabbed a video of me playing. Later that day, Honeybuns told me that there was a chapel at Laughing Heart that had a piano, so (almost immediately) I went to check it out. I noodled on one of the progressions I was playing with at Artisun, and a lyric came to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is who we are <br>
In the fields, in the bars <br>
In the streets, in the cars <br>
In the roots, in the fire <br>
And all that we need in the world is to see our reflection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the Long Trail, I had an idea to create a musical project, “wind river highway”, inspired by time on the trail, but nothing came of it. I think my problem was that the Long Trail was only 273 miles, and inspiration apparently doesn’t come until mile 274.9.</p>
<p>I stayed up a bit late tonight, using the hostel wifi to join my normal Monday night hang out with friends “back home”, and by back home I mean Georgia, DC, PA, NY… we usually chat from around 7pm to 8pm and then watch a movie together, and now even 8pm feels late for me. On one hand it was good to update them on how the trail has been, on the other it was nice just to fade into the background and be part of a conversation among old friends, even if I did have a harder time relating to the details of city life than I would have just a month ago or so.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-23">AT Day 21: Laughing Heart Hostel to Spring Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/23/2024</div><div>11.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>274.9<!-- --> to <!-- -->286.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="32/100">😳</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="30/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Of course I stopped by Artisun for a departing coffee/piano visit. Chris walked up as I was enjoying my drink, and we hung out a bit before I moved on — it turns out that Chris is a climber. He said he was meeting up with friends when he got to New Hampshire, so I told him to go visit Rumney. I wonder though, at least for myself, whether I’d have any arm strength by the time I get there. Town stops like this are great for calories, but I can feel my body redistributing itself as I spend more calories than I carry. I weighed myself at the hostel this morning: 146 pounds. I don’t remember exactly how much I weighed before I left, but I’m going to guess I’ve lost maybe 5 pounds so far.</p>
<p>I crushed the ascent out of Hot Springs today! Along the sidewalk of Hot Springs itself are diamond-shaped AT markers embedded into the concrete sidewalk, but almost immediately after Artisun, over the bridge, the trail takes a hard right and hugs the river for a bit. And after a nice scenic river view, it goes <em>up</em>, and with a full stomach, I attacked it. After a few hours I caught up to Snail Mail and Fire Magic and we hiked together a bit, taking a little detour to check out a fire tower. Two for two on fire tower opportunities! This one was great, too — no rickety steps, and the top was enclosed and protected from the wind. We stayed up there for maybe an hour, looking out and chatting. A local Tennesseean came up for the view, and we chatted with him a bit. One thing I remember him saying, he mentioned seeing some hikers speeding down the trail, somewhat oblivious of their surroundings, and he couldn’t understand why someone wouldn’t slow down just a bit and enjoy the outdoors. I’ve been trying to strike a balance with nature the whole time I’ve been out here, and I told him that once you’ve been out here for a few months, the trees start to blend into each other. Sometimes the thing that’s beautiful is not this particular tree in all its glory, but the comparison of these trees to those completely different trees you saw last week, some 100 miles back. He nodded as if to empathize, but I can tell he bears a strong preference for being able to appreciate the trees in front of him. Personally I wonder a bit if a thru hiker is cursed to lose the ability to enjoy the thing they came out here for, but so far I still feel like I’m net positive.</p>
<p>We got to the shelter by around 5pm. A few days ago, I covered 3 or 4 shelters in a day, and today, I took 2 days to get from one shelter to the next. It all comes out in the wash. Snail Mail, Fire Magic, and I found spots to pitch our tents and grabbed some dinner at the picnic table. Snail Mail got her trail name from the care packages she gets, as she’s taken the mail drop option for resupply. Her family is doing a lot to personalize each drop, which sounds awesome. It’d be nice to hang out with this crew for a little while.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-24">AT Day 22: Spring Mountain Shelter to Flint Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/24/2024</div><div>22.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>286.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->308.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="41/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to slow down">🥵</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today I hiked more or less the whole day with Fire Magic. We made a stop for cookies — there were signs for a Cookie Lady about 5 miles into the day, and it was a short walk to a cabin. There was a policy of 1 free cookie, $2 for any additional — I won’t say how many cookies I ate, but it was the right amount. We also passed Big Butt Bypass toward the end of the day (the side trail names for this area are really getting me), and surpassed the 300 mile mark! There was the number 300 spelled out in a rock formation on the ground to mark the spot, and we managed to grab a photo of the milestone.</p>
<p>At the shelter, Fire Magic reunited with Lost. Lost said that Fire Magic kept him going on the trail for a bit. It’s crazy how hikers intersect, separate, and come back together. Around the picnic table at dinner, I mentioned something about ursacks as I’m planning to switch to one in Virginia, and a dude in a kilt sitting around the fire interjected. Apparently his ursack was destroyed by the bear at Standing Indian, ripped at the seam, and he thinks now that ursacks are a ripoff. I was torn between feeling a bit sorry for this guy for having lost his food, and thinking that hanging an ursack to a tree at a shelter with a known bear problem was kind of a bad idea to begin with. I’m looking forward to swapping my big bulky heavy bear canister for an ursack when I get further north, but ursacks aren’t great protection against habituated bears. The dude was clearly mad so I didn’t push it, but Lost made a point of saying, you’re in the bear’s home, you can’t really be mad at him. Dude’s still mad, though I was happy to hear Lost say it.</p>
<p>Phoenix, a German woman we had met yesterday hiking with her friend Fire, arrived and came in with us in the shelter, saving some space for Fire who should arrive shortly. But as bedtime came and Fire didn’t, I could sense Phoenix was concerned. With everyone else in the shelter sleeping or on their way, Phoenix sat upright, anxiously sighing and looking at her phone. I asked her from underneath my quilt if she was nervous about her friend; yes, she said, Fire should have arrived by now. They were carrying one inReach between them, and Phoenix was the one carrying it. She got a text a few hours ago, but hadn’t heard anything recently, and there wasn’t enough signal here to get a message out. I told her that if she decided she’d like to hike back to look for her, I’d be happy to walk with her. She took me up on the offer, and soon everyone in the shelter was awake, transitioning from sleeping shelter mates to willing search party members. I made a point of bringing my first aid kit with me, wondering how much I remembered from my wilderness first aid 2-day class. Luckily, we hadn’t hiked more than a half mile or so before Phoenix exclaimed that she had enough signal to send a message; a few minutes later, texts were exchanged with Fire, and it turned out that she had lost her way earlier, but was closing in on the shelter soon. A few minutes after that, we could see her headlamp in the distance, and there was a brief tearful reunion with hugs to go around. I was glad, mostly for Phoenix but also just happy not to have to discover just how much of my first aid training I had forgotten.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-25">AT Day 23: Flint Mountain Shelter to Bald Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/25/2024</div><div>18.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>308.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->327.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="66/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="listen to your body">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="31/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>There were happy goodbyes this morning as Phoenix and Fire were together again. Phoenix complimented me by calling me a dancer, and when I misunderstood and said that no, I’m not a dancer, she explained that I appear to dance when coming down the trail with my trekking poles. I took this as high praise, as I never really hiked with trekking poles before last year, and I’ve been working to get used to them.</p>
<p>Fire Magic and I started the day out together, and hiked together for some of the first few miles. There was some really awesome trail magic around 3 miles in at Devil’s Fork, where I was able to grab some fresh fruit and bars but also snag some really well wrapped toilet paper. I stayed for maybe 30 minutes, waiting for one snack to digest before tearing into the next one, and talking so some of the really nice folks running the trail magic stand.</p>
<p>I almost caught up to Fire Magic again (this time with Lost), as they were leaving yet another trail magic stop 12 miles in just as I was arriving. I’ll never refuse food, and an orange was definitely a welcome interruption. The trail angel asked me what my number was, referring to the number on my hang tag, and when I told him, he said he hadn’t seen anyone with a number that high yet. The numbers are sequential, so someone starting on January 1st might be #1 while I, starting on April 3rd, was 1961. The higher your number at any given spot, the faster you’re probably going relative to those around you, and most of the hikers I was hiking around had lower numbers and had started sometime in March. It’s tough to know really who’s ahead and who’s behind you, but I definitely feel like I’ve been going faster than a lot of people I’ve met.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, I had caught up to Fire Magic, and we took in the peak at the top of Big Bald. It was just Fire Magic, me, and a dude sitting in a tractor, staring out into the horizon. It really was a good view, but it was starting to get a little chilly, and we decided to make the 1.2 mile trek back here as a sunrise hike. The views this time would be infinitely better than Clingmans Dome.</p>
<p>As we ate dinner at the picnic table, a hiker came in relatively late (just before sundown) and went off immediately to set up her tent. Her name was Rabbit, and I guess she had gotten the name from hiking big miles. I thought that I had done some big days, pushing past 20 miles a few times, but Rabbit I think started after me. No sooner had I puffed out my chest for having a high hang tag number than I met someone who most likely had a higher number than me. I tried peaking at Rabbit’s hang tag when she came back just to see how high the difference was, and was a bit ashamed of myself. I imagine Rabbit will probably speed right by and that’ll be that, but it was good to remind myself that there are people on all ends of things. <em>“This is a marathon, not a sprint.”</em></p>
<p>Fire Magic and I stayed in the shelter so that we could pack up quickly in the morning, and we were the only two there. We chatted a bit about expectations for the trail, tramilies, and a bit of my inner fight between wanting to make connections along the way and wanting to stretch my legs. Fire Magic was not creating expectations around who she might hike with or for how long, and that makes sense. Some people you don’t see for a while but then reconnect out of the blue, she said, and some people you only hike with for a day and then never see again. But then she mentioned this one time when an older guy we both knew (someone I met only briefly at Fontana Dam) behaved pretty sketchily toward a younger woman we both knew. While I’ve enjoyed seeing the good and bad of people and being part of a trail community that tends to bring out the good in everyone, it was a bit disheartening to hear about the <em>other</em> side of someone who didn’t initially strike me as a bad dude, but appears now to have definitely behaved badly at times. And Fire Magic and I were both almost falling asleep by this time, but in my sleepy mind, I drew a distant parallel between that guy and myself, and wondered if Fire Magic was getting any bad behavior vibes from me. I was definitely too tired to ask or to try to redirect if that was the case, but I fell asleep with a feeling of wanting to avoid giving off the wrong impression.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-26">AT Day 24: Bald Mountain Shelter to Uncle Johnny&#x27;s Hostel</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/26/2024</div><div>16.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>327.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->344.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Building">🏠</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="45/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to slow down">🥵</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="3/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>The sunrise hike happened! It initially seemed as though it might be overcast, but we actually got some beautiful views.</p>
<p>In my haste to get up for sunrise, I didn’t pull out any snacks for the day. A normal person would stop, take a moment to enjoy their surroundings, maybe? and take out some snacks from their pack before repacking and starting out again. But that would take too long, so I decided to bust out the first 10 miles of the day and figure out food at the first shelter. I caught up with Fire Magic at the top of the first hill, and there was a moment where she might have thought I would hike alongside her as I did the other day, but I explained poorly that I didn’t pack snacks very well so I was going to hike fast. Writing this now, I don’t think that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Reflecting, I think there are maybe 3 reasons that I hiked fast this morning? One, because I get anxious about taking breaks when I could be moving, two, because Rabbit is an enigma and I’m curious if I could catch up to her, and three, I wonder if I may have given Fire Magic a weird impression last night. The fact that I have enough energy to get pretty poor sleep last night but still hike 10 miles without eating anything is just icing.</p>
<p>I caught up to Rabbit just before Spivey Gap. She asked me if I saw this gigantic tree a little while back, and this interaction sticks with me because I missed it, and I conflate missing a gigantic tree with hiking too fast to notice the little (or big) things. But I guess it goes both ways, as I remarked to Rabbit about how quiet this gap was, and she said she didn’t notice on account of wearing headphones. I guess we all notice the things we notice.</p>
<p>I passed Rabbit, but she leapfrogged me around a half mile before the shelter as I was getting water. I arrived at the first shelter and ate lunch before rearranging my pack and waited for Fire Magic to catch up. I originally anticipated hiking into Erwin with Fire Magic, but as she made her lunch, I reconsidered, wanting to get to Uncle Johnny’s soon so that I could get some chores done.</p>
<p>While I was on the Long Trail, I saw one interaction that sort of redefined how I see thru hikers hiking together. As I was having breakfast with a guy, his friend announced he was planning to start walking for the day. The guy I was chatting with replied that he’d be ready in 20 minutes, after he finished his breakfast and hit the privy. I expected some sort of negotiation, either a “I can wait 20 minutes” or “I’ll eat quickly”, but instead, both did exactly what they said they were going to do, and hiked separately for the morning. I guessed that, when you’re hiking almost 2200 miles with someone, you don’t have to hike all of those miles together. But I’m a consensus-driven person by nature, and I’m still figuring out how to make decisions independently of the people around me.</p>
<p>When I got to Uncle Johnny’s, I ran into Live Mas and Lost and caught up a bit. That bit about reconnecting with people you haven’t seen for a while is really true — I don’t think I’ve seen Live Mas since I met him at the Fontana Hilton. It was still raining, so I ended up holding off on chores, but Rabbit walked the two miles into town to pick up some cork so she could hand-carve her own insoles. That’s pretty badass. Fire Magic arrived shortly thereafter, and we did laundry together. The loaner clothes here aren’t quite as cool or comfy as those at Laughing Heart, but the outdoor shower was novel and felt good.</p>
<p>We all went out for Mexican food. I think this might be the worst Mexican food I’ve had in my life, but as always I’m grateful for the calories, and the portions were large enough that I couldn’t even finish my meal. I think my hunger now outstrips the physical limitations of my stomach.</p>
<p>Rabbit indeed does have a higher number than me, and started on April 6th. She lives in a converted school bus with oak floors, and makes her own pemican. She’s planning to do 20 to 30 miles a day. My wanting to get miles out of my body doesn’t in any way compare to her wanting to see how far she can push her body. I asked her about this war (that I’ve been fighting internally) between hiking socially and hiking aggressively. She said she’d like to meet a tramily that also does similar distances, but she doesn’t want to sacrifice movement. I feel similarly, even if our ideas of pushing ourselves are scaled differently. Fire Magic is planning to take a zero day tomorrow and reconnect with Snail Mail and Honeybuns. As cool as it would be to see the both of them, I don’t want to sacrifice movement, so I guess that means sacrificing hiking with Fire Magic, Snail Mail, and Honeybuns.</p>
<p>Talking to Live Mas, I learned that not everybody is out here for the same reasons. (Shocking.) I mean, some people see this as a vacation, and when the days get hard or the weather turns sour, and they type 1 fun isn’t happening, they take a rest day and have fun off trail instead. I guess that makes sense, but if you wanted a vacation, why not a cruise, or hike the Camino de Santiago where your gear and meals are taken care of, instead of hiking with your tent on your back for 2200 miles? I came out here because home life is far too comfortable, and I want to be comfortable being uncomfortable. But we’re all out here for different reasons, at different life stages.</p>
<p>We had this conversation in conjunction with my decision to tent in the rain, instead of staying in the bunks. Live Mas and Rabbit collectively convinced me to “upgrade” to a bunk. Of course it stopped raining shortly thereafter.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-27">AT Day 25: Uncle Johnny&#x27;s Hostel to Beauty Spot</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/27/2024</div><div>10.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>344.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->355.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="44/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to slow down">🥵</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="3/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>If anybody ever tries to convince me that sleeping in a bunk is more of a vacation than sleeping in a tent, I’ll remember this moment. I think the dude on the bunk directly below me has sleep apnea. I slept terribly. And the bed wasn’t that comfortable. And I paid more money for the privilege. Next time, I’m taking the tent, even if it’s wet outside.</p>
<p>Uncle Johnny’s has bikes for rent, and I went for a ride with Fire Magic and Live Mas to resupply, get coffee, and visit McD’s. It reminded me that not all bikes fit all people, and I think Fire Magic did the best job finding a bike that fits her, while Live Mas’ bike was practically a low rider. After getting back to Uncle Johnny’s and repacking my bag, I finally left the hostel at 3pm.</p>
<p>The last time I left this late in the day, it was 7 miles uphill out of the NOC. And honestly, when I got to the first shelter some 4.5 miles in, I thought I might stop there for the day. But then when I arrived, I chatted with some section hikers that had planned to finish the day at Beauty Spot, another 6.5 miles in. I had read about Beauty Spot! I had even saved an article to my phone that said, if you’re going to camp anywhere on the AT, make sure to stop at Beauty Spot, where you can see both a great sunset and sunrise from your tent. I grabbed some water, and did some quick mental calculations, but that took too long so I just started walking and ran the numbers while on foot. It was 4:45pm, which left me relatively 3 hours or so to make 6.5 miles. And how many people might be there? It was a Saturday night, and the article said that this was a popular spot with the locals. I’d have to get there with enough time to find a good tent spot and get dinner before settling down to watch the sunset.</p>
<p>Toward the last climb, I could feel the wind howling. I made it to the summit before 7pm, almost perfect timing, and I was surprised to see only 2 or 3 other tents there. Rereading the FarOut comments, it seemed as though maybe Beauty Spot used to be a spot where you could order delivery pizza, but now the roads here were closed. Sorry, locals! It was still windy, but one of the other tenters told me that, if I camp right next to a certain fire ring, the wind was significantly dampened by some trees. And so I set up tent where they mentioned, and enjoyed one of my finer ramen noodle packets under a beautiful sunset. I thought about the definition of luck. Before getting on trail, luck was when preparation meets opportunity, but now that I’m out here and I’ve prepared as much as I can, luck to me is an awareness of those opportunities and the flexibility to meet them. I was tired when I got to the shelter today, but as soon as I heard the section hikers talking about Beauty Spot, I wasn’t so set in stopping there that I couldn’t pivot. And the views here were absolutely worth it.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-28">AT Day 26: Beauty Spot to Clyde Smith Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/28/2024</div><div>15.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>355.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->370.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="40/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->😐</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>Of course I was the last one out of camp this morning.

<p>Today was a balance of pretty scenery and feeling pretty weak. It was really pretty at the first summit, how the forest was spread out enough to let the light shine through, and I saw cool flowers, plants, and rock formations. But I felt kind of weak today, maybe just because of pack weight and heat. Maybe I need to learn to sleep better.</p>
<p>When I got to shelter, I saw that all the FarOut comments mentioned that someone here had norovirus last week, so everyone is tenting. That’s fair.’</p>
<p>A number of the people tenting here know each other — there’s a lot of people hiking that are part of an ex-military thing, I think to help them transition back into civilian life. We all ate dinner while sitting on a giant log to avoid sitting on any surfaces near the shelter.</p>
<p>On some of the trees by my tent site, I could literally see leaves growing out of the stems of the branch tips. I’ve never spent so much time with trees.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-29">AT Day 27: Clyde Smith Shelter to Mountain Harbour B&amp;B</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/29/2024</div><div>24.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>370.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->395.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="78/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take it easy">🫨</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="38/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>I guess a good night’s sleep is helpful! I just crushed the Roan Highlands.</p>
<p>Roan Mountain was a super interesting start to the day, as the dense forest cover made me think about pulling out my headlamp, it was so dark. But then it descends directly down to a highway. After that, I was pretty much out of tree cover for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>On the first bald, there was one sign identifying all the mountains on the horizon within North Carolina, and on the other side, one sign identifying all the mountains in Tennessee. The trail itself walks the border between the states. It was such a clear day, over the Tennessee horizon, it was possible to make out Mount Rogers, the tallest peak in Virginia. It was kind of exciting to know that I’ll be walking over Mount Rogers sometime soon.</p>
<p>While descending the last mountain, I passed a “Leaving North Carolina” sign. Even though the trail has been technically hugging the NC/TN border for a while now, I’m now free of NC, and into my third state!</p>
<p>My legs felt like they could have gone on, and I kind of wanted to crack 26.2, but not yet. At the end of the day, I decided to go with Mountain Harbour hostel, as it looks like they’re supposed to have a good breakfast. As I was standing next to the highway looking at how best to get there, who should walk down the road toward me, but Brightside and Kyler? It really is a small world, or at least a small trail.</p>
<p>The hostel was a short 0.1 mile walk from the road. After not getting much in the way of sleep at Uncle Johnny’s, this time I’d grab a tent. I struggled a bit getting stakes into the ground, but I made it happen, and went to grab some dinner. And speaking of a small world, who should come in but somebody I’ve hiked with from the <a href="https://mitoc.mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Outing Club</a>? His trail name is Pocket Hulk, and I have to practice calling him that so that I don’t slip into first names. I hung out with Pocket Hulk and Hiawassee (named so because he managed to take the Hiawassee shuttle not just once but several times) for a little bit, but it’s time to call it a night.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-04-30">AT Day 28: Mountain Harbour B&amp;B to Moreland Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>4/30/2024</div><div>18.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>395.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->414<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="42/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>Two things about Mountain Harbour.

<p>I passed another milestone today — 400 miles! This time, the milestone was spelled out with sticks instead of stones. And the first few miles of Tennessee don’t disappoint: I walked for a few miles today by a beautiful babbling brook that could have come from <em>A River Runs Through It</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve had this logistics challenge that I’ve been trying to figure out: the GMC End-to-Ender panel is coming up on Friday, and there’s a dry run for it tomorrow. I’ll need to find a hostel with wifi tomorrow, and either zero for a few days, or keep on hiking and find another hostel for Friday. Ideally, it’d be nice to do the real thing in Damascus, given that it’s the home of the Trail Days festival (as much as I don’t care about Trail Days), but that seemed like a stretch mileage-wise. I mentioned this to Noah, and he told me about the Damascus Marathon, which is when you hike the 26.2 miles from Iron Mountain Shelter to the <em>Marathon Gas Station</em> in Damascus. That would be epic, and I think it just might work.</p>
<p>An intrepid little mouse just scurried right out into the light. Brave little sucker, though I guess this is more his home than mine, as he’ll still be here tomorrow.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-01">AT Day 29: Moreland Gap Shelter to Boots Off Hostel</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/1/2024</div><div>14.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>414<!-- --> to <!-- -->428.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="75/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take it easy">🫨</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="37/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Tennessee continues to impress; I saw a cool broken down house alongside the trail this morning. And the surroundings just feel <em>different</em>. I don’t know if I’m just projecting, but each state seems to take on an ever so slightly different geology. Yesterday, Tennessee gave me a babbling brook, and today, it gave me a roaring waterfall, and then it invited me to walk next to the falls for a bit. Tennessee is overdelivering for sure. I almost stepped on a turtle right after passing two hikers, so I waited for them to catch up so I could point the turtle out to them, and one of them commented that the turtle is NOBO. All he needs I guess is a hang tag.</p>
<p>Boots Off hostel seemed like a good spot to do the dry run rehearsal for the End-to-Enders panel, so I’m stopping here for the night, even though it’s only 12:30pm. I set up my tent next to a chicken coop (which might be quieter in the morning than a highway or a guy with sleep apnea?) and went about getting situated, when who did I see but Gambit? Last time I saw him, I think, was right before the Smokies, when he was meeting up with his wife. Apparently, he had to go to the ER due to an unknown infection, and he’s just waiting another day for the antibiotics (which don’t do well with sunlight) to do their thing.</p>
<p>Not long after, Rabbit rolls in as well, and Noah, then Lost a little while later — yet again, it really is a small trail. The hostel ran us to the supermarket (pretty poor bar selection, had to supplement from the gas station) and to McD’s, and then back to the hostel. Around 6:30pm, I jumped on a zoom call (what technology!) with the End-to-Ender panelists, and we walk through how the real thing will actually happen. It was pretty surreal to talk about my LT experience while in the middle of the AT. Also, one of the other panelists is someone I met on the LT, Aimee! It was great to hear the diversity of different speakers; the GMC did a really good job sourcing people, and I feel proud to be a part of it.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-02">AT Day 30: Boots Off Hostel to Iron Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/2/2024</div><div>16.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>428.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->444.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="43/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="9/100">🥵</abbr></div></div><div><p>Oh man, I learned a lesson today. I left Boots Off around 10:30am (because it’s only a chill 16 miles to Iron Mountain) and, about an hour later, arrive at this dam. On FarOut, the dam has an icon that says it’s a dependable water source, but the comments seem to indicate that FarOut is just trolling and there’s no place for actual hikers to get water. I didn’t fill up this morning before leaving the hostel because there’s <em>always</em> water along the AT. Until now, and it’s hot out, and super exposed. I haven’t had to think about long water carries since my very first day, but today I had to ration water and it was not fun. For a while now I’ve been able to improvise about a lot of things, but I need to be smarter and more intentional about water. I spent about 20 minutes at the spring just drinking and filtering/refilling.</p>
<p>It took my body a bit to chill itself out, but I made it to the shelter by 5pm. And who did I see there, but Brightside and Kyler! (And then Liberty!) Except that Kyler is now Grave Digger. Brightside and Grave Digger (but not Liberty) are planning on doing the marathon tomorrow too, and the lot of us take up the shelter space (Liberty is tenting because he doesn’t need to be woken up so early thank you), and talk about what time we plan to get up in the morning. Noah’s planning on leaving around 4:30am or so, while Brightside and Grave Digger might do a 5:45am departure. I’m not especially good at getting out of camp in the morning, we’ll see what happens. I’m a little anxious, but pretty excited.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-03">AT Day 31: Iron Mountain Shelter to Broken Fiddle Hostel</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/3/2024</div><div>26.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>444.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->471.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Building">🏠</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="47/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="4/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>I hiked the Damascus Marathon! And I crushed it.</p>
<p>Got started with the sunrise, right around 6:30am. I noticed after the first hour that I was keeping a 3.25 mile/hour pace; if I could keep this going, I could finish in about 8 hours. Just after a hill, I passed a guy named Trek coming the other way, and assumed he was a local. (We’re not supposed to have southbounders just yet, I don’t think?) I guess he’s doing a section, but he’s done this before, and had lots of stories to tell. I passed an old building with the AT logo painted big on the side.</p>
<p>I caught up with Brightside and Grave Digger as they were taking a break at the first water stop, and with Noah on one of the hills. I was moving pretty fast, but I never felt winded, it felt sustainable. Part of me tells myself that I needed to go fast so that I could get into town and make sure everything is ready for the panel tonight, but since pulling into Mountain Harbour, I’ve been wanting to stretch it just a little further over that 26.2 mile line.</p>
<p>Just after 1pm, I crossed into Virginia. Damascus, just 3.5 miles to go! Seemingly, the VA ground feels a little softer, with pine needles underfoot compared to Tennessee clay. Goodbye Tennessee with your beautiful waterways and nonexistent privies, hello Virginia. Let’s see what you’ve got to offer. I’ve heard that it’s the blues, but we’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>I came down the hill into Damascus an hour later, and it reminded me a bit of coming into Hot Springs, where you just walk into a trail town, except I could see backyards with pools with people in them. It felt like when I was a kid and everybody’s backyard was my territory. After passing the first house or two though, the trail took a left turn onto the street, and I was into town, walking through a town park. I slowed down as I walked past the entrance sign. With Damascus as a trail icon, the home of the Trail Days festival, I had seen so many pictures of this sign, and now I was walking underneath it.</p>
<p>I finished up at the Marathon gas station (so fitting), but I had to walk an extra block and then back to the hostel to make it an official 26.2. As I opened the door and asked about checking in, everybody was so chill, but I had all the excitement of having just completed my first hiking marathon and the post-race comedown that comes with it.</p>
<p>The End-to-Ender panel went really well. The questions were great, the enthusiasm was great, and the photo slideshow at the end brought it all together. Such a crazy moment, celebrating the potentials of Long Trail adventures for the attendees, while celebrating reaching the ceremonial halfway point of the AT.</p>
<p>Also, this hostel has a piano. I may have played it a little bit.</p>
<p>Noah and Rabbit convinced me to zero. (Rabbit may have compared my lack of zeros so far to self flagellation.) I guess my legs are a bit tired, I could use some sleep, and I’m kind of curious what a day’s rest will be like.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-04">AT Day 32: Broken Fiddle Hostel</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/4/2024</div><div>0.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>471.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->471.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Building">🏠</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="49/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="5/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today was my first zero. It was pretty ok! I tagged along with Brightside and Grave Digger who were planning to hitch to see a movie. Finding a hitch there wasn’t too hard, But finding a hitch back from a crowded parking lot in town clothes far away from the trail community was hard. It started raining as we stood outside a gas station, and one guy drove up just to tell us that he thought it might be illegal for us to hitchhike. Finally, someone who had just come from watching the Kentucky Derby picked us up and gave us a ride back. God bless Grave Digger and his ability to make small talk with virtually anyone.</p>
<p>I did a bit of song writing on the piano here at Broken Fiddle. I started in on a second song the other day, just a one liner, but added a tiny bit of a chorus on the piano today. The idea of a trail-inspired music project feels real enough that I told Dana and Dan about “wind river highway”. I did a mini concert for Noah, plus a British guy (whose name I unfortunately can’t remember) and two women. They were really kind. I miss playing for people. It was kind of cool to just play piano on the porch as the rain came down.</p>
<p>Fire Magic and Live Mas caught up today, but of course they’re taking a zero tomorrow so I’ll drift from the both of them again. A number of us went across the street to get ice cream at Dairy King. Makes sense that the queen would have a husband, and now I know where he lives. And speaking of ice cream, there was one spot that had affogato potential, but their espresso machine was broken. The trail must not want me to have an affogato.

It was awesome.</p>
<p>About an hour into hiking with Rabbit and Noah, I see that I’ve got a text from work, and it’s not just anyone from work, but the head of my department, asking if I can chat. I usually keep my phone in airplane mode, but I’ll take it out of airplane mode sometimes when I take photos and I want them to have location information. I had 2 bars, which is about as good as I ever have in the woods, so we tried calling.</p>
<p>Maybe a bit of background. I’ve been at the same company for close to 9 years, but it’s gone through some changes, including an IPO and being acquired twice. They were cool enough about letting me take 90 days of personal leave to start the hike, but I wasn’t sure myself whether I’d be coming back. With the most recent acquisition, our little division of the company was getting restructured, and a number of people were let go, but I came through unscathed. It turns out that I made it past the first round or so, but I didn’t make it past them all. Ultimately, this is really good for me: it frees me up to finish the hike without having to worry about employment, and I think it comes with a severance package as well, which helps offset the cost of everything. This is maybe the best possible scenario for me, given that I’m out here caring more about being out on the trail than being gainfully employed.</p>
<p>After the call, I caught up with Rabbit and Noah, and we celebrated. Hooray, I lost my job! I’m free!</p>
<p>Today was the Grayson Highlands. All I knew about the Grayson Highlands is that they were maybe a little similar to the Roan Highlands, and that they had ponies. Both of these things turned out to be mostly true. Noah was happy to seek out the ponies and pet them, but I’m a rule follower so I didn’t touch the ponies. I’d like to think though that, if they had asked to be touched, I’d enjoy petting them.</p>
<p>We also passed Mount Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia! I remember, just a few days ago, I could barely make out this mountain off in the distance, somewhere north. Now it’s to my south. Sometime after Rogers, we noticed that we had crossed the 500 mile mark without even noticing. We didn’t want to walk a mile back just to find it, so we created our own “501” mile marker. It was the prettiest milestone marker ever, with some nice serifs and everything. We left it there in the hopes that someone else would get a sliver of the amount of joy that we got from it.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-07">AT Day 35: Wise Shelter to Trimpi Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/7/2024</div><div>20.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>504.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->524.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="44/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="11/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Another day with Noah and Rabbit! And Noah is now named Fluff! We said goodbye to the ponies, seeing a few of them within 10 minutes of starting this morning. We started at just after 7am, which for me is actually really good, but I was still the last one ready.</p>
<p>I spent part of today trying to coordinate where to schedule a mail drop for my summer gear. According to the Internet, Pearisburg VA is more or less a good spot assuming you start with the bubble and hike at a normal speed, but I still need to figure out where best to send it. I tried texting a hostel in Pearisburg to see if they accept maildrops, and they do! So hopefully I’ll have summer gear in a few days. In addition to having lighter sleep clothes and a lighter quilt, I’m also swapping out my bear canister for an ursack, given that I’m out of the areas of the trail (I think) that had <a href="https://appalachiantrail.org/trail-updates/georgia-to-virginia-food-storage-order-national-forest-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a rule about hoisting ursacks as if they were bear bags</a>. It was tricky to text back and forth, given it was raining and reception is what it is, but I was able to huddle underneath a trailhead sign, and Rabbit and Fluff hung out with me while I figured it out.</p>
<p>Today was a solid 20 miles. Fluff is feeling it, and is pretty sure he couldn’t sustain this pace all the way until Maine, but it’s cool to hang out while we can.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-08">AT Day 36: Trimpi Shelter to Chatfield Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/8/2024</div><div>16.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>524.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->541.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="56/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take it easy">🫨</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="26/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>We added a new friend today, hiking with Tennessee Switch who we met at the shelter. And Liberty found us, too! We heard we might be able to get hot showers and pizza around Partnership Shelter, about 10 miles in, so we made that our lunch destination. Turned out that the showers were turned off (though it is a fancy looking shelter!), so we walked just a little bit farther to the road where we could order pizza, right outside a visitors’ center. We ordered <em>so much food</em>. We tried hard to eat as much as we could, but ultimately we moved my food from my bear canister into Rabbit’s bear bag, and stored the leftover pizza in my canister, which might stay edible for a day or so. I don’t know how food works.</p>
<p>I weighed myself on the scale in the visitors’ center, and I’m down to 140 pounds. That’s down from 144.4 at Broken Fiddle, and this time I’m wearing all my clothes. I don’t know how accurate these scales are, but I’m definitely losing weight and I don’t think the pizza is going to put a huge dent in that.</p>
<p>Around the end of the day, we walked through a small patch where you could see charred ground. Controlled burn, maybe?</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-09">AT Day 37: Chatfield Shelter to Knot Maul Branch Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/9/2024</div><div>19.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>541.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->560.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="44/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="19/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Last night, there was a pretty good thunderstorm, and I woke up once or twice in the middle of the night. I’m such a light sleeper, and I don’t know how many times I’ve slept through the whole night on trail — probably not that many. At first it seemed like maybe my body might not need a ton of sleep out here, but it’s starting to wear on me, just a little bit.</p>
<p>I saw a little side trail this morning with a sign that read “Museum”. Fluff and Rabbit kept walking, but I wanted to check it out, so I called ahead that I’d catch up, and followed the side trail. It was kind of cool! I guess it was part of the Settlers Museum; basically, it was a bunch of old farm machinery. But the main thought I had when checking it out was, I’m used to being able to go on side quests whenever I want to, and the dynamic has been a bit different the past few days. I’ve been focused on enjoying my time with Rabbit and Fluff, but I’m not sure right now how to fit in moments to enjoy myself.</p>
<p>After checking out the museum, I caught up with Rabbit and Fluff, and we stopped at a gas station at a road crossing. The gas station had some kind of frozen milkshake machine, where you’d take a cup out of the freezer, put it in the machine, and it would stir it up. So fancy! Behind the counter, there was a listing of all the US presidents, and Trump’s face was pasted over Biden’s; we’re definitely in Trump country right now. There were some Trump t-shirts too.</p>
<p>After filling up on sugar (which I’m sure we’ll burn off shortly), we walked over to an alpaca farm. I saw real live alpacas! This was a great rest stop — we did some laundry, we bought some food, got a ride into Walmart for a resupply, and gifted our leftover pizza to Eggs and Bacon.</p>
<p>Taking a small step back — I don’t know when I first heard about Eggs and Bacon, but I’ve been seeing their names etched into shelters, signs, and the like for some time now. There were rumors about their backstory, but the only thing I knew definitively was that it was a dad (Bacon, I think?) hiking with his young daughter (Eggs?). Also, I guess they had made some kind of apology after being caught tagging one of the shelters in the Smokies, though there was some speculation over whether their apology was heartfelt. The other thing I know about Eggs and Bacon is, they stopped at the alpaca farm on the same day that we did. Rabbit and I had really tried to eat our leftover pizza from yesterday, but it was time to part with the remains, and the cheese was only going to stay fresh for so long inside of my bear canister. So I asked Bacon if they’d be interested; he asked Eggs if she wanted pizza, she said “heck yeah”, and our leftover pizza found a new home.</p>
<p>I also bought some alpaca socks for my mom for Mother’s Day. It’s pretty easy for all the days to kind of run into each other, but Mother’s Day is at least one day I didn’t want to forget. I’m going to try to send the socks home when I ship back my winter gear.</p>
<p>Virginia has been really pretty so far. I know I’m supposed to get tired of it eventually, but at least so far, it’s a really pretty state. Also, those olive gardens? Turns out those were rhododendron bushes. (Hell, I didn’t know.) And they’ve started blooming.</p>
<p>Today was another big milestone: we passed the quarter way mark! We took pictures next to a “1/4 GA>ME” sign. It’s always exciting to pass another milestone, though it’s hard to really make it mean anything.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t mention- Fluff hiked the 15 miles from the alpaca farm to the shelter with a full-size apple pie on his back. We stopped at Walmart for resupply, and packing out an apple pie just seemed like the right move. When we got to the shelter, I was excited about devouring it, but it turns out that more or less everyone I’ve ever met on trail was stopped at this shelter tonight. Dema (now Night Whisperer?), Forklift, Mosey, Brightside, Grave Digger, even Hitman were all here. It was nice to see familiar faces! We still devoured the apple pie, though.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-10">AT Day 38: Knot Maul Branch Shelter to Jenkins Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/10/2024</div><div>20.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>560.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->580.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="48/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on recovery">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>I wasn’t the last person out of camp this morning! I was second to last.</p>
<p>Rabbit, Fluff, and I initially agreed to meet up at Jenkins Shelter, instead of all hiking together. I think this probably works best for me, at least — I feel like I can be more observant when I’m by myself. But Rabbit sent a text saying that she arrived at the shelter shortly after 1pm, and that she was going to push on. Rabbit’s gotta rabbit, it was only a matter of time before she had to be free. And on the same day, I got a text from home saying my summer gear is arriving in Pearisburg on Monday, so it doesn’t make sense for me to go fast and catch up. Oh well, it was pretty fun hiking with Rabbit and Fluff for a few days.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I did see some animals! I saw a bear cub running past me, and I almost stepped on a very full rattlesnake who happened to be sitting right on trail. Two animals in one day!</p>
<p>Also, Virginia continues to be pretty. I ran into Live Mas on top of Chestnub Knob as he was finishing up his lunch. Just gorgeous views.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-11">AT Day 39: Jenkins Shelter to Jenny Knob Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/11/2024</div><div>23.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>580.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->604<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="77/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take it easy">🫨</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="35/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today, I saw the less gorgeous side of Virginia, as I crossed the interstate via an overpass. I guess it’s impressive that I’m able to walk for miles upon miles without crossing interstates more often, but it’s definitely not very sexy.</p>
<p>I saw a sign that said “please, no deer carcasses.” I can get behind that statement. I’ve also been seeing signs for shuttle buses to Trail Days, and people have been talking about it of course for quite a while. I think maybe half the hikers I’ve met are going and half aren’t, and I’m definitely not going. I get little sleep as it is.</p>
<p>I crossed the 600 mile mark today! My shoes could have been retired 100 miles ago, but they’re still going strong. They’ve got a little hole in them around where my Lone Peaks blew out (after only a week), but it’s been so dry that the hole doesn’t really bother me.</p>
<p>I guess I’m never too far away from hiking with someone I know — I’m back again with Brightside, Grave Digger, Live Mas, Forklift, and Mosey. And I finally met the other Liam from Boston! “Kachow” has been hanging out with these guys, and he’s from the south shore (Hingham I think?), which is close enough to Boston. Brightside extended an invite to Woods Hole hostel tomorrow, so I think I’ll tag along.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-12">AT Day 40: Jenny Knob Shelter to Woods Hole Hostel</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/12/2024</div><div>21.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>604<!-- --> to <!-- -->625.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="69/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take it easy">🫨</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="46/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today was a tiring but good day. I had lunch at Dismal Falls, and landed at Woods Hole in the afternoon. All of our tents are set up in a nice little row. I’m starting to see some flowering buds on bushes, I think this is mountain laurel? And now <a href="https://mountainlaureldesigns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mountain Laurel Designs</a> makes sense to me. I also saw a whole dear family just before Woods Hole. Given that I only saw one dear before stepping foot in Virginia, it’s pretty easy to say that I saw more dear today than all previous days on trail combined.</p>
<p>Woods Hole is just a great place, favorite hostel along the trail hands down. The woman who runs it strikes a slightly hippy but very homey vibe, and it just works really well. Really relaxing. And the food was so good! Less showy than Mountain Harbour, but made with more love, if that makes any sense. I ate so much food today, I pooped twice. We played Codenames tonight, my first time playing Codenames in person since before the pandemic. Somehow I came from behind to win, I guess my Codenames shit talking skills haven’t worn off too much.</p>
<p>I’m glad I was able to call my mom today for Mother’s Day. We did a FaceTime Audio call, which somehow works better than a phone call given the signal. I won’t be able to send her the alpaca socks until tomorrow. I wish I could have made the day better for her, but I think the only way I could do that would be to be back home in MA instead of out here on the AT in the first place. I hope she’s not too anxious about me being out here.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-13">AT Day 41: Woods Hole Hostel to Rice Field Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/13/2024</div><div>18.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>625.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->644.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="65/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take it easy">🫨</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="48/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>On my way out of Woods Hole, Hitman shouted out to me, “See you in 3 weeks!” There are a few people I’d definitely like to see again before this trip is out, and Hitman is on that list.</p>
<p>Live Mas and I half-walked, half-hitched into Pearisburg. The town isn’t all that walkable, but we made it work. I was able to pick up my summer gear from the Post Office: fresh clothes! a lighter sleeping quilt! an ursack to replace my bear canister! Everything I wanted was in there. There wasn’t really anywhere to change in the post office, so I went over to Food Lion to resupply then over to Dairy Queen to meet up with Brightside, Grave Digger, and Live Mas, grabbed some food, then headed back to the post office to ship my winter gear back home, along with my mom’s socks.</p>
<p>Getting back to the trail, Live Mas and I hitched with this dude sporting a confederate flag front license plate and some pro-Trump stuff in the back seat. These are the kinds of people my Massachusetts friends and family might be nervous about, but I’m trying to keep an open mind about people on and around the trail, and he was nice enough to pick us up and give us a ride back, even if he was a bit of a weird dude.</p>
<p>Back on the trail, Live Mas and I hotstepped it up to Rice Field shelter. Pretty much everybody that didn’t zero at Woods Hole is here, and there’s another tramily too who fit a pretty typical tramily vibe. There was an interesting conversation where they thought we were all in denial as to our tramily-hood (a bunch of us are traveling loosely together but not calling ourselves a tramily), and we thought they’re taking their tramily perhaps too seriously. I think they have an official tramily song? Or handshake? Or game they play on trail. They travel together exclusively. I don’t know if I’d count myself part of a tramily at all, with only a loose association to the other people I’ve been with, but the contrast is kind of funny between the two groups.</p>
<p>There was a bit of fog as Live Mas and I got into Rice Field, but it’s cleared up now, and it has really pretty views of the valley. It’s just really nice out here.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-14">AT Day 42: Rice Field Shelter to Bailey Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/14/2024</div><div>16.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>644.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->660.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="76/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take on the day">🤩</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="52/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>Always the last person out of camp. Technically there were some peeps in the shelter that looked like they were waiting for weather to improve, but other than that, I was the last one out. Eventually I caught up to Live Mas and Kachow around Pine Swamp Branch shelter where we chatted with a section hiker and I took a food break. I’m feeling a bit tired today.</p>
<p>Rabbit texted to say she’s getting off trail due to a family emergency. Oh no! That sucks a lot. I’ve thought before that if my family had an emergency, that’d probably be the one kind of thing that would bring me off trail. I hope everything will be ok.</p>
<p>I had planned initially to meet up with Patrick and Rachel in Harpers Ferry in early June, but that was before I had gotten on trail and had any idea what my pace might be. It looks like Patrick will be out until June 3rd, and Rachel will be out the first weekend of June. Gah, trying to plan logistics with only a cellphone on limited battery and 2 bars of LTE is really really hard.</p>
<p>I met ‘Roid and his friend at the shelter tonight, they seem to be doing similar miles, I imagine I might see them again.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-15">AT Day 43: Bailey Gap Shelter to Sarver Hollow Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/15/2024</div><div>21.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>660.9<!-- --> to <!-- -->682.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="68/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="take on the day">🤩</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="54/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>I saw what I think is my first undercast today! And then I took a little side trail to some high cliffs where I spotted some kind of gigantic bird pruning itself, but I couldn’t get close enough to see just what kind. Standing on this cliff was maybe the first time I’ve felt like, if I took a fall, it’d be a long way to recovery. Good thing I didn’t fall.</p>
<p>Virginia isn’t actually flat, but it probably spends more time being relatively flat than some of the other states. That being said, it invites you out into these wide valleys where you get a beautiful view of everything around you, with forest to one side and the rest of the world to the other. Really pretty.</p>
<p>I saw ‘Roid again and met Fish Stick today, having lunch at War Spur shelter. They happened to mention while chatting that they had both been passed by Rabbit, and how fast she was; I had to tell them that she had to get off trail, and I wasn’t sure if she’d be back. I ended up passing Fish Stick later on in the day — he was moving at a good clip, and I felt compelled for some reason to keep up, and I guess I wore him down, as he ended up giving way to me. I didn’t mean to be competitive, but sometimes it comes out.</p>
<p>I saw cows today! They were close by and mobile, so I did kind of a shit job at getting photos of them. But cows are pretty cool.</p>
<p>I spent enough time today out of the trees to see storm patterns (plus, atweather.org predicted them), and they caught up with me at the end of the day. I didn’t really want to make the steep 0.3 mile descent down to Sarver Hollow Shelter (and I’m not excited about making the steep ascent in the morning), but when I arrived I discovered it’s actually a great shelter to wait out the rain! It was a barn of a shelter, with plenty of room to hang things to dry. There was also some good camaraderie as we were all stuck here in the wet. Altogether a pretty good end to the day.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-16">AT Day 44: Sarver Hollow Shelter to Lost Spectacles Gap</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/16/2024</div><div>21.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>682.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->703.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="78/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="64/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>If I ever do the AT again (unlikely), I should make sure not to go over Dragon’s Tooth at the end of the day, having just hiked 20 miles. That was kind of stupid. I wanted to stay and get more out of it, climb around a bit, but I was pretty tired by the time I got there.</p>
<p>I passed over the Eastern Continental Divide today (I didn’t know that was a thing), as well as a section that looks like it had recovered from a forest fire. I could smell it far before I could see it, so either it was kind of recent, or that acrid smell really sticks to the air. Maybe both.</p>
<p>And shortly before I got to Dragon’s Tooth: 700 miles! This milestone was made out of sticks.</p>
<p>Dragon’s Tooth looked like it shouldn’t have been empty. There’s no camping there, which makes sense? But without anybody there, it didn’t look right, like an empty building. It didn’t look natural, I’m not sure why.</p>
<p>I camped pretty shortly after Dragon’s Tooth, at Lost Spectacles gap. There were some other tents already set up, I think from the other tramily that we met the other day after Pearisburg. I had dinner with one of them and chatted a bit, but when they all got in (including Fish Stick from the other day), I just stayed in my tent. I don’t have enough energy right now for being social. I don’t think I have enough snacks to get me to Daleville, so I’ve been rationing a bit, but there’s supposed to be a spot tomorrow at the bottom of the hill maybe a half mile off trail that might have some food. We’ll see what happens.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-17">AT Day 45: Lost Spectacles Gap to Lamberts Meadow Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/17/2024</div><div>17.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>703.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->721.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="79/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="74/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>The trail provides! The trail provides! Just as I got to the road this morning where I’d have to turn off trail to do an unscheduled snack resupply, there was some trail magic! They had eggs and sausage, and one of them made me 3 peanut butter &#x26; jelly sandwiches, with a pro move of peanut butter on both slices of bread and the jelly in the middle, so that the jelly never leaked out. I was able to ride those snacks all day without even dipping into my own supply. I’ll make it to Daleville without having to get off trail!</p>
<p>While yesterday was Dragon’s Tooth, today I went through the other 2 parts of the Virginia Triple Crown, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. It was a pretty cloudy day so the views weren’t great, but the trail was really easy going — you can tell which sections of trail are highly traveled by day hikers, when the trail starts getting exceptionally well groomed and well marked. I saw a lot of day hikers today, as well as day hikers who were hiking the VA Triple Crown.</p>
<p>I sat out the rain inside the shelter, and chatted with an ex-MIT professor as well as a guy who helped me identify different pine needles as well as sassafras trees. Good to move that tree identification goal along! I was pretty tired by the end of the day, so I tried to get some rest — but who should show up at the shelter, but Gambit? It’s a small trail after all, and still I always see Gambit when I least expect to.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-18">AT Day 46: Lamberts Meadow Shelter to Fullhardt Knob Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/18/2024</div><div>14.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>721.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->735.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="73/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="72/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I resupplied in Daleville today. The walk into town was a strange one. There’s a new development going up right where the trail meets the highway, and a whole ton of deer that just watched me walk by. It’ll be strange, I think, when these houses are finished and have people living in them, but then again I guess it was strange to be walking by peoples’ houses in Damascus too. I didn’t have to hitch or anything into town, as the Kroger’s was only a half mile or so on the road, though it wasn’t the most peaceful road walk. The shopping area had a Kroger’s, a barbecue spot, a cafe, and a Wendy’s (and a Bojangles, but I didn’t, even if it’s more local). I made sure to get breakfast before resupply. I’m still trying to figure out how much food to buy — it seems as though the amount of calories that will fit in my bag is not enough calories to keep me from losing weight. At the cafe, I asked the woman behind the counter whether she could make an affogato — she didn’t know what it was, but when I told her that I think it’s just espresso plus ice cream, she said that could make both of those things! So, I had my first affogato on trail today!</p>
<p>I went back to the cafe after resupplying because I still needed to charge my power bank, so I had way too much coffee today. While I was there, I ordered my first replacement pair of shoes from REI! Online advice mentioned ordering over the phone, and it was really helpful to coordinate a spot where the shoes and I would both arrive in somewhat the same time frame. And that spot, as it turns out, will be Harpers Ferry.</p>
<p>The walk out of town was pretty nice and gentle. I ended up at the shelter with Gambit and Star Trooper, who I had met at the coffee shop. I let slip a comment about how the trail itself is kind of the antithesis of Leave No Trace, how there’s no bigger trace on the land than a path carved into it for the purpose of supporting thousands of people walking every year. I realize after having said it that these aren’t the conversations best launched within a day of meeting someone, but this has been my headspace as of late.</p>
<p>Another milestone: I passed a sign that said “1/3 of the way to Katahdin”! Feels like just yesterday that I was 1/4 of the way.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-19">AT Day 47: Fullhardt Knob Shelter to Cove Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/19/2024</div><div>20.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>735.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->755.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="76/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="well recovered">😃</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="78/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I ended up leapfrogging with Gambit today, but mostly stayed in front of him just a bit.

I remember reading that the colocation of this highway and the AT is one of the things that divided Benton MacKaye and Myron Avery. So far, at least, I can’t see why Benton MacKaye was pissed.</p>
<p>After camp chores, Gambit suggested an “extracurricular” hike to me and the one other guy at camp to watch the sun go down from the view some 0.1 mile down the trail. I wish I had this idea more often. We just sat on the rocks and chilled as the sun went down, it was pretty good.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-20">AT Day 48: Cove Mountain Shelter to Harrison Ground Spring</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/20/2024</div><div>20.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>755.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->776.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="78/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="well recovered">😃</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->😐</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="84/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I spent most of the day just powering through, but when I got to camp, I just … sat down, for like a good solid 10 minutes or so.

<p>I made the mistake of trying to wash my socks by hand. I don’t really know what I’m doing. The more water I poured on them, the more dirt came out, and there was just no end to the dirt, such that by the end of it, they just felt dirtier.

<p>Gambit is aiming at getting to a brewery on Friday, which is not a thing I’m all that interested in, but I’m down to hang out and hike together at least until then. Today, we resupplied in Glasgow. Glasgow was great! We had maybe the easiest hitch ever, and it had pretty good options. Just one “Grocery Express”, but it had everything I needed at decent prices. There’s technically a “shelter” in the center of town, with electrical outlets, a shower, firewood for a fire (the mayor kept bringing more), and some light trail magic. Seems like a nice way for the town to attract hikers.</p>
<p>At the shelter tonight, I met my first southbounder! I was excited, until I figured out that they were flip-flopping, and had started in Harpers Ferry. I wonder when I’ll meet my first southbounder who started in Maine, and what that’ll be like.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-22">AT Day 50: John&#x27;s Hollow Shelter to Cow Camp Gap Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/22/2024</div><div>23.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>789.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->813.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="15/100">😵‍💫</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="26/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Last night, some guy came into the shelter after dark with his light turned on, having just hiked a marathon. Shortly thereafter, he asked if we had any bug spray. I was kind of annoyed (first off, no I don’t carry bug spray, second, shouldn’t you have your own bug solution? third, it’s after bedtime and everybody’s clearly trying to sleep), and just said no, sorry. A few minutes later, his headlamp is back on, and he decides the bugs are too much, and he leaves to set up his tent. And that’s when I noticed the bugs too. Honestly, after the fact, I’m guessing the bugs would have kept me up even if this guy hadn’t. I guess these are the No-See-Ums I’ve heard about? They kept Gambit up, too.</p>
<p>When I was figuring out what to bring out on the trail, I decided not to bring any bug spray or bug net or anything. Mosquitos and gnats at home never bother me, especially if there are other people around. But I think that maybe the fact that I’m not used to No-See-Ums is partly why I wasn’t prepared. They were brutal.</p>
<p>Gambit and I had an early lunch at Punchbowl Shelter, surrounded by bullfrogs at the pond. A few hours later, I passed the 800 mile mark! This milestone was marked with actual stones. We finished the day at Cow Camp Gap Shelter, which was annoyingly far away from the trail. Initially we thought we both might chance another night in the shelter, as it was threatening to rain — but when a short hard rain came and went, we decided it was better to set up tents now than wait until we were half asleep and getting eaten alive like last night.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-23">AT Day 51: Cow Camp Gap Shelter to Harper&#x27;s Creek Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/23/2024</div><div>24.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>813.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->837.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="80/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on sleep patterns">🥱</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="44/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today I passed The Priest Shelter — their log book invites you to confess your trail sins, like not digging a cat hole or skipping an unsavory part of the trail.

<p>I made a detour today to Humpback Rocks. On one hand, it was a really cool view! On the other hand, it’s getting hard to appreciate really cool views. Bright blue skies, long sweeping vistas, that’s pretty much every day this month. It’s frustrating because I <em>know</em> I’m looking at a beautiful view, it feels like it should evoke something, but all I can do is take a picture, sit down and stare for a minute or two, and get back to walking. Maybe this is the Virginia Blues. It’s been a really pretty state so far, but the days blend into each other.</p>
<p>Rabbit texted me and Fluff to say she’s coming back out onto the trail! I texted back a picture of the overlook. I told them about the privy at The Priest, too — better than all the privies in Tennessee combined, I said. Heheh. I have to imagine she’ll probably catch up to me before I’m done, it’d be cool to hike somewhere in New England together or something.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-25">AT Day 53: Paul Wolfe Shelter to Calf Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/25/2024</div><div>12.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>859.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->872.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="79/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="well recovered">😃</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="77/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I got into Waynesboro by around 9am. I remember when I’d still be under my quilt at 9am! The trail came up to a turnpike, and across the turnpike was a hollowed out Howard Johnson’s and a delightful popcorn stand. I’m glad I stopped at the popcorn stand — there was a bunch of phone numbers of people who volunteered to shuttle hikers into town! I had success with the first number I texted, and ate popcorn while I waited for them to come pick me up.</p>
<p>I asked her if she could drop me off at a cafe (of course), and I settled down to charge electronics and consume baked goods (no affogato). After hanging out for a little while and squaring away my Shenandoah permit, I made my way over to Kroger, then the laundromat, and grabbed a burrito while my clothes spun. I was able to snag a ride back with the same person that gave me a ride in, and gifted her my remaining popcorn for the trouble. I’m never sure if I should pay for a hitch? And cash is such a difficult commodity, I’m scared to part with it.</p>
<p>While in town, I was able to square away plans with <del>Patrick and</del> Rachel! We’ll try to meet up in Harper’s Ferry on June 2nd. It really is hard making plans with folks. At least today I had the ability to plan while on wifi and connected to power. I created a section in the Reminders app on my phone to keep track of things I need to do when I’m on wifi, things I need to do when I’m in town or able to charge my phone, and so on.</p>
<p>It’s a little unclear to me how much I was in Shenandoah National Park today — it seems like I entered? But Calf Mountain Shelter is not technically in the park? But the shelter is packed — looks like I’ll be staying in the shelter itself tonight as all the tent spots are taken, and I’m not excited about visits from the No-See-Ums. I met Bibo (short for brown in/brown out). His family joined him to do the Shenandoah section together. I talked to his sister about labor unions, and to his brother about Huel.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-26">AT Day 54: Calf Mountain Shelter to Pinefield Hut</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/26/2024</div><div>26.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>872.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->898.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="43/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="33/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Ugh. I didn’t sleep at all last night, maybe like 45 minutes or so. I tried covering as many inches of skin as I could with clothing, but the No-See-Ums just focused on whatever wasn’t covered. I tried burying my entire self underneath the quilt, but I just did laundry yesterday, I really didn’t want to sweat through everything already. I need to make sure I arrive to shelters early enough to score a tent spot, I can’t do another night of No-See-Ums.</p>
<p>But enough about bugs. Shenandoah! I saw so many deer, as well as a woman peeing on a tree on trail. I tried to give her advance notice by tapping my poles together; she quickly readjusted as though nothing had happened, and looked down at her gear as I passed, avoiding eye contact while I tried to give her at least a little grace. Humans are weird, the whole lot of us. I’ve heard that this is perhaps the easiest part of the trail to move through, so I moved fast to start (3+ mph), until I kicked a rock HARD and now my 2nd toe is black and blue. 🤬 Luckily this was right before a hut, so I stopped in to take a look, but it didn’t look as bad then as it kind of does now. There was a guy at the shelter who had found a copper head snake hiding in the rocks of the shelter, and he was trying to get close to it to get a good look. I never really understood the mentality of “oh, a deadly snake, I think I’ll go annoy it” but this guy was just showing genuine curiosity, I think that maybe I can empathize a bit.</p>
<p>I kind of limp-hiked on from the hut (damned if this toe was going to shorten the length of my day, I just can’t press off that toe but I’m ok), and even limp-hiking, I was still passing the day hikers. I made a rest stop at the campstore. When I told the guy behind the counter that I had just kicked a rock, he said that would make him so angry that he would have punched something. That’s all I need, a bruised hand to match my foot. He noticed in my apprehension to reply that our reactions would probably be different, and he complimented me on choosing the less violent path. I’m just trying to walk here, really.</p>
<p>Inside my tent tonight, I literally watched a thunderstorm come on as a wave. First the wind rattled the trees, and then the rain a few moments later, and then the thunder and lightning. Nature is pretty cool.</p>
<p>I finally finished the Brave New World audiobook, after whittling it down during so many nights in my tent. This was assigned reading in high school, which is probably why I barely read it then, but now I can finally appreciate it. And it fits my vibe for this hike too, as someone living just outside of society and not at all convinced that society is right about things. I want to say that I wonder what it’ll be like when I finish this hike, and I’d like to think that it’ll be ok but I’m not always looking forward to it. This trail has been a privilege that I’ll miss, even if I kick my toe occasionally.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-27">AT Day 55: Pinefield Hut to Bearfence Mountain Hut</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/27/2024</div><div>20.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>898.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->919.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="84/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good sleep last night">😃</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="68/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>Kicked off the day with another milestone, 900 miles! This is the last mile marker in triple digit country. I also think I saw a grouse on the trail this morning, going southbound? It looked well fed, and didn’t stir at all as I passed. I’m guessing the animals in the park have plenty of food available.</p>
<p>I leapfrogged one hiker named No Plan a bit in the morning, and as we chatted a bit at a water source, it turns out that she’s from Vermont. We ended up having lunch together and hiking together for most of the day, including stopping for snacks (ice cream, yogurt as a beverage, and a giant pickle, what choices) at Lewis Mountain Campground. The lady running the desk closed up while we were hanging out, but she said we could stay as long as we wanted. No Plan is doing big miles and so we probably won’t overlap for long, but I think we might hang out for just a little bit longer and enjoy some more of these waysides.</p>
<p>The AT Guide plan recommended not resupplying too heavily in Waynesboro because there would be plenty of food inside the park, and now I see what it means. Every day affords at least one stop at a “wayside” which has plenty of snacks. Supposedly there’s one or two that offer a blackberry milkshake, which I’m especially looking forward to. But I was pretty happy with my pickle in pickle juice electrolyte treat today.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-28">AT Day 56: Bearfence Mountain Hut to Pass Mountain Hut</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/28/2024</div><div>26.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>919.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->945.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="63/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="56/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>The blackberry milkshake is a thing!

I’m really going to miss the ability to just buy calories in the middle of the day. I bought postcards to send back home too, hopefully they stay dry.</p>
<p>I got caught in a quick storm not far from the Byrds Nest #3 hut, and I was literally running down the trail trying to get there to escape the rain. By the time I got there, the storm had passed, and I spent a few minutes just drying out and eating a quick snack. After getting back on trail, I passed two other hikers who looked dry; I said that they had clearly done a better job avoiding the storm, and they replied, “what storm?” I guess these thunderstorms can get pretty localized.</p>
<p>I finally pulled into Pass Mountain hut a little on the late side, so I set up my tent and grabbed some food. No Plan and I ended up chatting for a while and I barely noticed as the sun went down around us. We grabbed a selfie (I still think back to Mosey saying that you’ll want to capture yourself at moments along the trail) and called it a night.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-29">AT Day 57: Pass Mountain Hut to Tom Floyd Wayside</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/29/2024</div><div>23.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>945.9<!-- --> to <!-- -->969.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="68/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="62/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I spent most of the day trying to catch No Plan, but never did.

<p>I’m out of Shenandoah now, and on to Front Royal tomorrow. This shelter is a bit weird, with a network of blue blazes leading to different tent sites and a water source.

I asked the driver if he was headed back into Front Royal, and he said he was; I asked him if he could give me a ride, and he said he could. This was an even easier hitch than in Glasgow! I hopped in. The driver had hiked a good portion of the trail himself, and had a trail name of Smooth. He taught marksmanship at a local firing range, and he applied the same lesson he taught there to the trail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve never heard this saying before, and I think I really like it. Maybe I can use this to get better at standing up my tent.</p>
<p>Front Royal was really nice. I got my second affogato of the trail (it wasn’t on the menu, but they knew what they were doing). Smooth had dropped me off right in front of the local outfitter, and apparently they were working together with the local brewery and bakery to offer a spot to do laundry and take a shower. Good on them, and I ended up patronizing all but the brewery. I signed their whiteboard wall too, inspired to join the ‘A’ and ‘T’ of Marathon into an AT symbol. They had a bathroom scale next to the shower, and I’m down to 137 pounds now. Ugh. After cleaning up, I walked down to the visitor center to check if I’d have enough time to hit up the grocery store before the trolley returned to the trailhead; it looked doubtful, so I decided to resupply at the outfitter’s instead. While I was there, a guy offered me a ride back to the trailhead without me even asking! The people here are SO NICE. On the way back, he talked about his hobby of overlanding, and we compared our experiences of getting away from it all for days (or months) at a time.</p>
<p>I wrote a few days back about sometimes being underwhelmed by even the most epic Virginia views. Well, sometimes they still get me. Virginia really does have some pretty hills.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the trail, I’ve been kind of triangulating mileage based on how I feel, where others are landing, and the 3 itineraries available on the AT Guide website. When I started, the 15 mile plan was closest to my speed, but at least right now, the 18 mile plan seems closest to how far my legs want to go. But the plans are still pretty old, and today the 18 mile plan mentioned a shelter that doesn’t exist anymore. Turns out it’s been replaced by Whiskey Hollow shelter. I arrived a little on the late side, around 6:45pm. I don’t know anyone in the shelter, but everyone seems nice enough.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-05-31">AT Day 59: Whiskey Hollow Shelter to David Lesser Memorial Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>5/31/2024</div><div>29.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>987.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->1017.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="75/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="64/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I had made up my mind to hike the entirety of the Roller Coaster in one day, which might be stupid because I camped last night almost 10 miles before it started. So today marks my longest day on trail so far, but also maybe my earliest start without being spurred on by someone else.</p>
<p>I did it, it was good. I passed the 1000 mile mark, and left a “1002” mile marker for Rabbit and Fluff, should they ever find it, commemorating 2x the 501 marker we left way back when. I’m so tired. Time for sleep.</p>
<p>I sat down to dinner next to Freedom, a German guy, and we chatted for a little bit. When I sat down exhausted, I think he almost immediately took me for someone obsessed with miles at the expense of smelling the roses. I don’t even know anymore where I am on this spectrum, but this is the longest day I’ve ever hiked so I don’t know if this makes a pattern.</p>
<p>I’ve hiked 1000 miles now. I finally finished Virginia. I’m less than 10 miles away from Harpers Ferry. I did all the things today. Hence the sleeping.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-01">AT Day 60: David Lesser Memorial Shelter to Mile 1029.6</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/1/2024</div><div>12.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>1017.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->1029.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="62/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on energy levels">😩</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="38/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Ugh. Sometimes a day can be so good and so bad. It was really a beautiful walk into Harpers Ferry this morning. I remember Rabbit saying that ferns were her favorite plant, and hiking into Harpers Ferry surrounded by ferns on all sides, I can see why.</p>
<p>When I got to town, I stopped by the ATC headquarters, got my photo taken, got my photo taken again when I realized other people had gotten their photos while wearing their packs and I didn’t want my pack (which had supported me all this way) to feel left out, and returned to the trail, walking through town toward the edge where I might continue on. This felt like the spot I might return to tomorrow morning, and that would have been the case if two things didn’t go dramatically wrong: (1) my shoes weren’t actually waiting for me at the post office, and (2) there weren’t any open beds in town this evening.</p>
<p>I was kind of nervous about the shoes when I realized that REI had shipped them via UPS without really asking me. I wasn’t sure if a UPS package could be picked up from USPS, but the Internet wasn’t super conclusive. I was hopeful when the delivery status said that they had been successfully delivered to the loading dock and signed off on by someone named Ricky, but the people at the post office said they didn’t know anyone named Ricky who worked there. I looked out by the loading dock anyway, just to see if maybe the shoes had escaped notice, but wherever my shoes had been left 3 days ago, they weren’t here now.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll be walking some more miles on this same pair of shoes, which have carried me over 1000 miles and have a few holes in them.</p>
<p>Also, I initially pictured Harpers Ferry as a quaint little town, darling halfway point of the Appalachian Trail. Now that I’m here on the first Saturday in June, I’m finding it to be a claustrophobic slice of American history tourism where all the beds have been taken by tourists interested in American history. I’ve looked at some of the historical monuments but I still have no idea what history the town is famous for, other than being old.</p>
<p>I stopped for a brownie sundae to try to raise my spirits, and the woman almost finished taking my order before she remembered that they’re out of brownies. Fuck this place.</p>
<p>I ended up walking a few miles out to get to a nearby hostel, but I misread some FarOut comments about crossing the tracks on the way to the hostel, and walked a few miles past the hostel only to have to walk back on the other side of the tracks. It was actually mostly a nice walk along the Potomac on a nice bike path, but there would be no saving this day.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-02">AT Day 61: Mile 1029.6 to Ed Garvey Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/2/2024</div><div>3.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>1029.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->1033<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="31/100">😳</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="22/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>This hostel has a bit of a weird vibe to it, which just kind of exacerbates a feeling of “this wasn’t my first choice”. They have a bathroom scale, and now I’m down to 135 pounds. They also have a shaving razor, though, so maybe losing 2 months of beard accounts for some of that weight loss. I hung out with Rachel, and we planned to stop by a spot to eat that I saw yesterday in Harpers Ferry, but (it being a Sunday perhaps?) we couldn’t find any parking, and so we ended up abandoning that plan in much the same fashion that I had abandoned staying in town yesterday.</p>
<p>It was still nice to hang out, and Rachel drove quite a ways to come see me, but it was really hard to transition from a headspace of “the trail threw me a curveball and now I need to figure out how to adjust on the fly” to “how do I boil down the experience of 60 days of living on trail to a friend that I get to see for just a sliver of an afternoon?” I don’t know that I was a great conversationalist, but sometimes just having company is enough, and I hope that was the case for Rachel too. We got some fried chicken and some ice cream, and Rachel offered me the best trail magic of helping me resupply. And my permethrin order from Amazon was successfully delivered to a nearby Amazon Locker, so we were able to pick that up too.</p>
<p>I said goodbye to Rachel, sprayed my gear with permethrin, and more or less avoided getting back on trail. All in all, I could use a day off trail, but I didn’t want it to be at this particular hostel. I managed to convince one of the hostel workers to give me a ride back to where I had left off yesterday, which was a godsend as I didn’t actually start hiking until almost 7:30pm and arrived at the shelter just 10 minutes before sunset. Luckily I was able to find a tent spot fairly quickly. I’ll never stop being grateful, that I’ve gotten to where I am with no small amount of kindness from strangers, and friends alike. Harpers Ferry for me was mentally draining, but I’ve got a full pack again, and back on trail.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-03">AT Day 62: Ed Garvey Shelter to Pine Knob Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/3/2024</div><div>16.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>1033<!-- --> to <!-- -->1049.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="76/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="52/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>I came into some fantastic trail magic around lunch time and used it as a chance to work things out again with REI regarding the shoes. The problem is, they can’t ship them to a post office because these shoes ship directly from the vendor (Topo Athletic), and REI’s system doesn’t allow them to tell the vendor how to ship them. So I spent a good chunk of time trying to find a private address (hostel) that will accept packages and is the right distance away. Long story short, I’m going to have to hike 150 miles from where I started this morning to pick them up, and they’re not going to arrive until June 11th. That’s about 17 miles per day, far slower than what I’ve been used to.</p>
<p>But I got to thinking: one of the reasons I was hiking so fast to begin with was to get ahead of the bubble. I don’t have to hike 20 miles a day, and I’m pretty sure I can be happy without that. This also makes it easier for Rabbit to catch up to me. So, if you discount the part about having to hike more than half the AT on a single pair of shoes, this is a win. With this newfound freedom, I ended up taking a few breaks today, including getting trail magic for a second time from a guy who had hiked the AT a few decades back, I think in the 70s. I sat for over 30 minutes, chilling out with two hikers named Martian and PBG (Peanut Butter Giant).</p>
<p>At the shelter tonight, I talked about my shoes to a guy coming south (also a flip flopper, didn’t start in Maine), who had just come through PA. PA is kind of famous for having a lot of rocks, they even call it Rocksylvania. He said, as long as you get a new pair by Duncannon PA, I’ll be fine. I’ll get every nickel out of the shoes, but I’ll be fine. When I told him I wasn’t getting the shoes until some 30 miles after Duncannon, his face visibly dropped.</p>
<p>Oh, but hey, I’m squarely in Maryland now? And it seems to be celebrating its Civil War history via its trail system, with signs along the trail reading “Civil War Trails” with accompanying descriptions of a battle or march etc. I did pass some cool structures today. I think I made a mistake in sleeping here at Pine Knob Shelter, though — it’s so close to the interstate, I can still hear the traffic. Weird note: right before crossing the interstate, the trail cut right in between two houses, right next to someone’s driveway, and then right behind someone’s house. I had to double check the map just to make sure some nefarious well-resourced kidnapper hadn’t redirected the AT into the back of their truck.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-04">AT Day 63: Pine Knob Shelter to Deer Lick Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/4/2024</div><div>22.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>1049.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->1072.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="44/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="22/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today just felt <em>slow</em>.

A boulder field which is surely a sign that Pennsylvania is near! And finally, Pen Mar Park!</p>
<p>This was a good stop. I ordered a pizza and a coke, and sat on a bench eating it while I recharged my power bank. And when it was time to move again, I hiked another 0.2 miles to cross the Mason-Dixon Line and another state border into Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Good bye, Maryland. I was already frustrated when I entered you, and it wasn’t your fault; you’ve had some nice stretches with some interesting monuments, but you also put a trail right next to somebody’s house and under flyover country. My stay was short, but I wouldn’t have wanted it to be any longer.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-05">AT Day 64: Deer Lick Shelter to Thru It All Hostel</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/5/2024</div><div>13.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>1072.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->1085.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="68/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on sleep quality">🥱</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="43/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Last night I ended up at the same shelter as a guy named Guinness, who I think I also saw briefly at the last trail magic spot. We caught up with each other this morning at some trail magic at a park about 2 miles in, as well as a guy named Mad Hermit who had passed by this morning while I was still taking down my tent. They caught up again when I was getting water at the next shelter, and again when I was chasing down blue blazes for views (spoiler: views aren’t so great when it’s cloudy). They’re both headed to a hostel tonight that does free dinners on Wednesdays, and Guinness convinced me to come too. It seems like a pretty good deal: $12 to tent, free dinner, score!</p>
<p>The hostel is really a church that offers hostel services, and the dinner is an act of evangelism. Pre-trail me wouldn’t stay here to avoid hints of false pretenses, but hungry me will accept favors irregardless of intent. They make a point about prayer services being opt-in. All in all, the vibe is maybe a little off for my liking, but I would pay more than $12 for a meal alone, and this comes with free charging and wifi.</p>
<p>Guinness also has an X-Mid, and he spent some time helping me improve my pitch. It definitely looks much better now. No more getting my tent shoved into my face on a windy night!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-06">AT Day 65: Thru It All Hostel to Toms Run Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/6/2024</div><div>16.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>1085.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->1101.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="76/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="53/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>On the way out of town this morning, we stopped at a barbecue spot.

The owner noticed us, and invited us in for a minute for a cold drink. We came back this morning and I’m pretty sure that both Guinness and I tipped well for yesterday’s kindness.</p>
<p>A pretty big milestone today: I’m more than halfway to Katahdin. At this point, it’s probably easier to just walk home than to return to Georgia. (That’s always been the case, I guess? but now I’m closer!) We also passed the 1100 mile mark, which was the most decorated mile marker I’ve seen yet; both sticks AND stones.</p>
<p>And to top it off, as we were closing in on the shelter for the night, Guinness and I saw a peacock on trail. No idea if it was born here or escaped a zoo.

And I didn’t want to bother anyone so I tried not turning my headlamp on, but then I stumbled around and walked into some bushes and then it was time to turn on my headlamp after all. Oh well.</p>
<p>Today was relatively chill. It had to be, as most of the day was spent after CRUSHING THE HALF GALLON CHALLENGE. Though who crushed whom is an open question, as arguably the ice cream took a heavy toll. It took me an hour to ingest 2610 calories, but I did get a free wooden spoon for finishing. There were a good number of us to cheer each other on, including Chattaa, Gremlin, and Judge, who I met last night over dinner. They did the 4 state challenge maybe the day before or so, and they were beat. And I think they were also beat by their ice cream, too, but they were good sports.</p>
<p>After gaining a few pounds in a single hour, I checked out the AT Museum. It had some cool stuff from Heather “Anish” Anderson (TIL pronounced “ANN-ish” not “AnEESH”) as well as some cool stuff from the trail’s earliest days. The trail from there was forgivingly gentle, aside from a small but cool rocky ridge that seemed to tease what might be to come in a few hundred miles. Tomorrow, I’ll check out Boiling Springs.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-08">AT Day 67: Alec Kennedy Shelter to Cove Mountain Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/8/2024</div><div>25.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>1120.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->1146.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="58/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="listen to your body">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="47/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>I saw a lot of trail runners this morning!

And on the way in, I walked through some <em>really nice</em> farmland. The trail literally goes through the middle of the field! I didn’t need to resupply, as I’ll be in Duncannon tomorrow, but I did decide to replace my water filter as I was passing an outfitter in town. My water filter has been leaking on me, and I’m not sure if it’s the filter itself, the collapsible bottle it’s attached to, or the fact that the water bottle pocket is a little constricting, but I’ll give a new filter a try and see what happens. I also grabbed some breakfast (technically multiple breakfasts) with a fancy coffee frappé thing. With enough stops like this, I might just stop losing so much weight.</p>
<p>The walk after Boiling Springs was really gentle, too. I bought a gatorade from an 8-year-old tending a farm stand. Just a really nice day.</p>
<p>The shelter tonight has a raised floor without front steps, and there’s a comment in FarOut about porcupine activity. I can’t tell if my shoes will be safe inside the vestibule, but I made sure that nothing is poking out from underneath, and the shoe laces are tucked inside the shoes. At the shelter tonight is Bonk, DK, Baby Kong, and iMom. I had dinner with them for a bit, but then crawled into my tent to call it a night.</p>

Saw a text this morning from Patrick when I got to the bottom of the hill. He’s still feeling pretty terrible, and definitely not about to drive 7 hours. And then it started raining. Walking into town, Duncannon has a much more industrial feeling than any of the other trail towns so far. 2pak (who I think I saw right before Damascus?) called out from one of the side streets, he’s hiking with his nephew for a few days. I got some breakfast at Goodies, then a latte (with half &#x26; half, pro move) at Doyle’s, then hung out at the Kind of Outdoorsy hostel with Martian and PBG. The woman running the hostel was nice even though I wasn’t staying, she made me a walking-friendly map to get to groceries and back. Even still, the road to Karns Foods/Dollar General was actively hostile toward anyone on foot. Karns and Dollar General are literally right next to each other, but you have to walk around a blind turn to get from Karns to DG.</p>
<p>Walking with Martian and PBG to get some pizza, Martian (who is actually from Mars, Pennsylvania) said that she likes Duncannon, that it presents the same true honest self to hikers that it does to its residents. I really respect that, I do, but yesterday in Boiling Springs was such a cheery day, and Duncannon has a cloud over it. It doesn’t help that today actually is cloudy.</p>
<p>On the way out of town, after I crossed the train tracks and went up the first hill, I paused to pick my nose. This is what passes for personal hygiene sometimes when you’re out for miles by yourself, I guess. After a minute or so of digging, I look up, and there’s a dayhiking couple on their way back into town. I have no idea how long they’ve been there. They don’t say anything but gesture a little hello, I say hello and let them pass, and we both continue on.</p>
<p>I haven’t been sleeping all that well lately, and I don’t want to hike faster than my shoes will arrive, so I finished up just a few miles to the first shelter.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-10">AT Day 69: Clarks Ferry Shelter to Yellow Springs Campsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/10/2024</div><div>20.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1154.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->1174.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="51/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="listen to your body">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="33/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>PBG and Martian tented out a mile past the shelter at a nice view, and I caught up to them while they were taking down. This was a nice spot to have some breakfast, so I chilled out for a bit with them. Just a little bit later, I ran into an older couple doing trail magic, and we sat and had twizzlers and oranges and asked when the rocks would get rocky.</p>
<p>There was a second trail magic stop later in the day, from a mother/daughter team. The mother mentioned that she always wanted to the AT, but eventually the years got away from her. I didn’t tell her that a fear of the same happening to me was a motivating factor for me being out here in the middle of my life, but I definitely thought it.</p>
<p>I got to Yellow Springs campsite around 7pm or so, and while the cold brew from the second trail magic was pushing me to continue to Rausch Shelter, I think I’ll stop here for the night. It seems cozy enough, and there’s a mailbox with a trail log in it. Martian and PBG came in a little bit after me and set up close by. I did the math, and I should get to Stay-AT-Swatara before noon tomorrow.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-11">AT Day 70: Yellow Springs Campsite to 501 Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/11/2024</div><div>22.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1174.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->1196.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="61/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="52/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>I didn’t want to trust that it would actually happen, but I got a new pair of shoes today! I was there to greet the UPS driver as he arrived. I took some pictures of old vs. new, and it’s amazing what a difference almost 1200 miles makes. The new shoes have clean soles! The new shoes don’t have any holes in them! Who knows what the future brings, but if these shoes last me the rest of the journey, I’ll be very very happy.</p>
<p>I wasn’t crazy about the Stay-AT-Swatara hostel itself. Some people really like it, as it’s very self-serve oriented. You mark down what you take and pay by the honor system. But the way the honor system is enforced is through a number of “smile, you’re on camera” signs, which is not my vibe. They did have a really cool pizza oven where the pizza rotates underneath a fixed heating element, so that’s nice. I chilled for a bit with Salamander, who I saw hike past Yellow Springs last night, saying he wanted to give night hiking a try. A hiker named Hero had collected a number of mushrooms and used them to create a tea. He offered it to all of us, and although it’s probably not the brightest idea to trust complete strangers about mushroom picking, I gave it a try. More or less tasted exactly how I thought mushroom tea might taste, and I haven’t died yet.</p>
<p>I know some other hikers have mailed their used up shoes home as a sort of souvenir. I threw mine in the trash. I had a moment of sadness, such a cruel fate for a pair of shoes that supported me for over half the trail, but they served me well, and they had no purpose left in them. I thanked them for their service and threw them out.</p>
<p>Before I even got to the hostel, I put my old shoes through their last set of paces, passing through a marshy spot that was flooded due to beaver activity. It was a fun balancing act and puzzle all in one, how to get from one end to the other without getting wet. I did accidentally dip my foot in partially, but overall managed to stay dry for the most part.</p>
<p>I landed at the end of the day at the 501 Shelter. This is supposed to be kind of an iconic shelter, where you can have pizza delivered, but I arrived pretty late because I was waiting for my shoes and didn’t get out of Swatara until almost 5pm. I caught up to Martian in the last few miles, and she didn’t think she’d make it in time to order pizza, so I told her I’d order for her. But by the time I got there, daylight was fading, and when I tried to put in an order for pizza, they said they didn’t deliver after 8:30pm. <em>It was 8:31pm.</em> A few minutes later, Martian came in, and I felt bad that I didn’t arrive in time to put in an order for her.</p>
<p>Bonk and DK, who I saw at a shelter the other day, offered us some of their leftovers. The trail provides! But it’s dark now. I’m actually kind of proud that I can set up my tent in almost no light by feel and memory alone, but I don’t ever want to come into camp this late again. Night hiking is not going to be my thing.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-12">AT Day 71: 501 Shelter to Saint John&#x27;s Church Pavilion, Port Clinton</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/12/2024</div><div>23.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>1196.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->1220.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="76/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on sleep quality">🥱</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->😐</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="42/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today just felt like the hardest day on the trail. I mentioned this to DK tonight at the shelter, and I don’t think it made any sense to either of us why today would be so especially hard for me today. It probably didn’t help for me to bust out 11 miles in under 4 hours last night on a brand new pair of shoes. I forget that sometimes shoes need to be broken in just a little bit, and my heels are a little tender now.</p>
<p>I’m also firmly in Rocksylvania now. When I first heard that northern PA would be rocky, I couldn’t picture it in my mind, but now I see. Just enough rocks to break your rhythm, sharp enough that you don’t want to put your weight on them. From what I understand, when glaciers were moving south during the last ice age, they left some good sized boulders up in NH, but what made it down here to PA were the crumbs.</p>
<p>I did manage to pass 1200 miles today though. Another really pretty milestone, with numbers spelled out in sticks surrounded by stones. A lot of today was actually pretty, with some pretty views of the valley, sparse woods, and pretty flowers. The descent into Port Clinton sucked though. It was super steep, and landed me in a train yard. This seems to be another industrial town. I set up my tent in a big grassy area (private land, owned by the Saint John’s Church who asks for donations from hikers who stay) — iMom, Bonk, and DK are staying in the pavilion itself, across the street.</p>
<p>I tagged along with Bonk and DK in a shuttle to the nearby Walmart, and Bonk introduced me to Wawa. I never knew that a gas station could fill this niche, and now I wonder why gas stations everywhere aren’t like this. At Walmart, I bought a pint of Ben &#x26; Jerry’s, a pint of chocolate milk, and a full-sized pie in memory of Rabbit and Fluff. Bonk said he had never met anyone with such a high tolerance for dairy; I said I’m not so sure my stomach has that high of a tolerance, but my taste buds do. I think I just really need the fat.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-13">AT Day 72: Saint John&#x27;s Church Pavilion, Port Clinton to Eckville Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/13/2024</div><div>15.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>1220.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->1235.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="33/100">😳</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="23/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I got breakfast in town this morning before getting a bit of a late start on the day. Pulpit and Pinnacle were nice. I spent a few minutes talking to a couple of day hikers who had lots of questions about the AT, who wanted to make it to Pinnacle but didn’t have time. I also spent some time ruminating while walking about how northern PA seems to have all the downsides of wilderness areas (not many blazes, not terribly well supported), plus all the downsides of urban areas (noise pollution, other forms of pollution), and none of the upsides; but then, the last mile before Eckville made a left turn into nice territory, and I remembered that, yeah, I actually DO like hiking.</p>
<p>Eckville itself was interesting. I guess it’s an old house that was converted into a shelter, and I’m not really sure who owns it. I tented on one of the tent platforms, but the grass there is actually taller than everything else around it. iMom is also here for the night.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-14">AT Day 73: Eckville Shelter to New Tripoli Campground</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/14/2024</div><div>13.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>1235.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->1248.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="72/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on sleep quality">🥱</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="47/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Met up with 2pak in the morning while I was still getting ready to leave Eckville. He had camped at Pinnacle, and made it to Eckville before I had left. We talked about doing slow miles, and made plans to have a late lunch at Thunderhead at 4pm. He then caught up to me at the first vista (Dan’s pulpit), and we chilled for a bit. I was only going 2mph, so I let him go first. A half mile later, a day hiker going SOBO said there’s trail magic at the road crossing 5 miles up. This must have given me a mission, because all of the sudden I kick it into high gear, and rocks mean nothing to me now. I catch up to 2pak at 3mph and set pace to trail magic, which sadly had already left. Plan C however becomes to wait for Thunderhead to open from the hostel just down the road, so we do laundry and shower there. I check my weight on the scale: 138.5, I’ve somehow <em>gained</em> a bit of weight! But then the storm comes, so we wait out the rain with some Chinese food delivery with Dax and Grit. It’s alright, I think 2pak didn’t want to be seen with me, given I was wearing the most outrageous loaner clothes I could find. After completely filling up (2 pints of chocolate milk too?), I head to the camp site, with clean clothes and completely avoid getting wet from the storm. Sometimes Plan C is the best plan.</p>
<p>The camp site was a bit dodgy. It wasn’t really clear if any of it was really made for tenting or not; there was broken glass around the spot I found. Baby Kong and I both made the best of it with our tent setups, and 2pak was just fine in a hammock.</p>
<p>It turns out that I won’t be able to meet up with Teresa and Carter in NY after all. Trail logistics are hard.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-15">AT Day 74: New Tripoli Campground to George W.

I’m a little torn as far as pacing goes. Having to wait for my shoes taught me to be ok with taking my time, but now that I don’t have an active reason for going slow, I’m trying to rectify a “last one to Katahdin wins, take your time and enjoy the scenery” approach with a “I want to feel my body move, let’s go let’s go let’s go” yearning. Part way through the day, I heard Kachow behind me, and Brightside and Grave Digger were right behind. I don’t even remember how long it’s been since I last saw them, probably around Woods Hole. We caught up on gossip, they told me about their time at Trail Days (this confirmed it, it wouldn’t have been my thing), and we hiked together to the next shelter, just a bit faster than I had been going before seeing them.</p>
<p>At the shelter, we took a lunch break, but my plan was to stay here for the night and walk into Palmerton, while their plan was to hike on. I went over and set up my tent and took an unencumbered walk down into Palmerton. All in all, the walk there and back was almost as long as my hike today, but it was mostly on concrete sidewalks, without a pack on my back. I almost didn’t want to walk back to the trail afterward.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-16">AT Day 75: George W.

<p>Today was a pretty big water carry. I had to walk almost 0.5 miles off trail past one of the shelters to get water. FarOut comments seem to indicate that some guy is slashing or tossing water caches that people put out, all because his last name is on a semi-reliable spring more than 0.5 miles off trail and he wants people to use that for their water. I passed his spring today and didn’t get water there out of principle and also I didn’t want to walk more than a mile for water. Tomorrow is supposed to be similar, but there’s supposed to be a hotel nearby where I can fill up.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-17">AT Day 76: Campsite before Wind Gap to Church of the Mountain Hiker Center</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/17/2024</div><div>16.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>1280.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->1297.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="no record">🤷</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="recovered and ready">🫠</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="61/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>Another long water carry!

After reading the FarOut comments a little more carefully, I guess I was supposed to message him in advance — I’m afraid I woke him up. When departing, though, he handed me a meditation pamphlet, I guess he gives that out to everyone. Over all, a nice guy making his way in the world, though the hotel was in various states of disrepair and I refilled my water directly from his kitchen tap.</p>
<p>Right after I crossed the street after leaving the hotel, there was a water cache at the base of Wind Gap parking lot. Maybe I didn’t need to stop at the hotel after all, but it was good to make the human connection. I stopped again for water at the next shelter which had it flowing from the faucet, and chatted with some day hikers there.</p>
<p>Delaware Water Gap seems like a neat spot! Seems on the touristy end. Shops stay open on the weekends and then close down in the middle of the week when the tourists aren’t around. Unfortunately, the coffee house that No Plan suggested is closed until after I leave tomorrow, so there won’t be any chance at an affogato for me.</p>
<p>I ran into Freedom at the hostel, who told me about a $2 shuttle to Walmart. They had kind of funky rules (I couldn’t get on the shuttle for any amount of money if I didn’t reserve it ahead of time, even if I was going to the same place and there was plenty of room), but I lucked out in getting a pretty quick shuttle both there and back. Another Ben &#x26; Jerry’s pint for me!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-18">AT Day 77: Church of the Mountain Hiker Center to Tentsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/18/2024</div><div>13.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>1297.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->1311.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="59/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="42/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>You know how they say, when it’s hot you should start early?

<p>I’ve heard that the New Jersey section of the trail over-delivers, and reminds you that it’s the Garden State after all. That seems probably true, but I spent most of the day trying to avoid the sun. My mom texted me last week about a “heat dome”, which must be the meteorologist term for it, but around here we just like to say that it’s pretty freakin’ hot outside.</p>
<p>I ended up walking a bit today with Baby Kong and Colonel. The three of us stopped by the Mohican Outdoor Center for some food, a cold drink, and some ice cream. Afterwards, they took the road back to meet up with the trail, but I went the purist route and walked back to where I had left the trail. Honestly, I think it was a more interesting walk- the climb out of the MOC was the only little steep part of the day, and mmaybe it even built some character, or at least a little bit of muscle, for when the hills come back further north.</p>
<p>NJ has a lot of “unofficial” tent sites with lots of tent spots. I ended up staying at the same spot as Baby Kong, Colonel, and iMom, which happened to be next to some good flowing water that didn’t come straight from a bog.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-19">AT Day 78: Tentsite to Gren Anderson Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/19/2024</div><div>17.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>1311.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->1329<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="41/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to slow down">🥵</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="11/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I really don’t like digging cat holes.

<p>I showed up kind of early to the next shelter, and had my pick of tent spots, but none of them are all that great. Baby Kong is going to try his hand in the shelter with the bugs.</p>
<p>I just noticed that there’s a road right behind the shelter. I remember that one of the twists in M. Night Shyamalan’s <em>The Village</em> is that, while you spend the whole movie thinking it’s set centuries in the past, it’s actually set in modern day, just miles away from suburbia. That’s pretty much how I’ve felt hiking through the mid-Atlantic states.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-20">AT Day 79: Gren Anderson Shelter to Unionville</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/20/2024</div><div>20.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1329<!-- --> to <!-- -->1349.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="52/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to slow down">🥵</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="15/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Baby Kong didn’t do so well in the shelter last night.

It feels weird for the trail to be this empty, and nobody knows where the bubble is now.</p>
<p>Baby Kong and the Colonel were out of camp before me, but I caught up to them a few hours later at some trail magic, and it was <em>amazing</em>. It was from a trail angel named Diva, and when you arrive, you sit down and place an order. Very little contamination risk, and it feels like I’m being served at a restaurant. It was a great respite. After that, a local wanted to hike for a bit together, so we got some walking in. I wasn’t sure how to pace him! But we did alright.</p>
<p>It was so hot today, I had an unintentional siesta inside High Point State Park. I had caught up to Colonel who was just leaving — I went in with the intention to fill up my water, buy a cold drink, and sit down for a bit, and ended up falling asleep on a bench.</p>
<p>I was initially planning to stay at the Secret Shelter tonight, mostly because it’s called the Secret Shelter. The grass was too tall though to support a tent, and the shelter itself was a heat trap. I hung out for a few minutes to read and sign the guestbook, and I felt like a dog left in a hot car for too long. While I was there I noticed a tick had hitched a ride on me — my first tick of the whole hike. So I pressed on to Unionville.</p>
<p>Unionville’s a cute town! (And they have affogato on the menu!) I’m camped in the park next to the post office, and it’s not all that great — I accidentally set up my tent in the exact spot where the flood lights are pointing, and there’s a bell that chimes every hour, all night long. It’s ironic how the closer I am to civilization, the worse my sleep tends to be.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-21">AT Day 80: Unionville to Wawayanda Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/21/2024</div><div>16.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>1349.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->1365.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="30/100">😳</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to slow down">🥵</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>I was sitting on the front steps of the general store this morning, and who did I see walking by, but the Colonel!

<p>The trail went through a national wildlife refuge this morning. I had some competing thoughts: on the down side, building a home for wildlife and expecting them to live there is kind of like building a Native American reservation and just expecting them to stay inside the boundaries- land ownership is not a universal concept. On the plus side, can you believe that we created a place with benches where people can just sit and watch things that are alive? And this is a very meditative place! You can just <em>be</em>!</p>
<p>I think I’m tending to dwell on the negative thoughts a bit due to lack of sleep.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon with the Colonel, Baby Kong, Bonk, and DK. We took a good long break today at a farm and garden center, mostly because it had stellar air conditioning. And the longer we hung out around the AC, the less we wanted to go hike up the next thing, which was the Stairway to Heaven. Basically the first real ascent in a while! It was good, but tough in the heat.</p>
<p>We’re all tenting at the shelter tonight. There’s also some overnight hikers staying inside the shelter. I find it kind of cute now to see someone do an overnight — good on you, friend, for getting out of your comfort zone and coming out here! I felt for them tonight as it ended up being a wet one. We ended up getting to the shelter with just enough time to make dinner and fill up on water before it started pouring.</p>

<p>I woke up “late”, around 6:15 or so, and I wasn’t sure if I’d make it to 11am shuttle pickup. Packed up super fast and headed out by 7:15. The first 3 miles were fast- I passed DK, and then Hero, but then the miles got hard. I was so soaked in sweat, I couldn’t unlock my phone  as I couldn’t dry my phone enough to press buttons. Kind of like the first rain when I crossed out of Georgia making it hard to grab a photo, but this time the rain was replaced with sweat, and I was under a deadline. Luckily, Hero came up on me a minute or so later and took of photo of me with the state line. With an hour left, thinking I had to get to 10.1, I had only gone 6.92, and the scrambles were not auto pilot-able. Luckily, around the 7 mile mark, the scrambles gave way to smooth ground, and I cruised, eventually catching up to Baby Kong and Colonel. We shuttled into town, set up tent at the drive in. I got lox and an iced coffee (with half &#x26; half!).</p>
<p>It’s kind of cool that this drive-in lets hikers set up tents. We’re basically behind all the cars, and we can see all 3 screens from here, so we get our choice of movie. They rent out hand-held radios so you can tune in. I’m going with Inside Out 2, largely because it’s the first one and it’ll have me in bed the earliest. It’s funny how drive-ins by nature don’t get started until after hiker midnight.</p>
<p>Before the movie I killed time either by chilling out or eating food or both. While I was chilling out in my tent, Live Mas arrived, and I caught up with him a bunch. Seems we’ve changed places a bit, where now he’s doing big miles and I’m on vacation. It’s cool.</p>
<p>The movie was fun. I’ve now seen more movies on trail than I’ve seen in much longer off trail, but hey, I’m on vacation! Hopefully tonight’s rain will be more chill than last night’s.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-23">AT Day 82: Warwick, NY to Fingerboard Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/23/2024</div><div>16.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>1376<!-- --> to <!-- -->1392.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="32/100">😳</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to slow down">🥵</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="1/100">🧟</abbr></div></div><div><p>New York has been more of a challenge than expected so far.

<p>I had a good morning in Warwick with Colonel and Baby Kong, getting some more town calories at the bagel place. After the shuttle back, we got a late start around 12:30pm. By the late afternoon, when we were still a little ways out from the shelter, I made a soft proposal of looking for a spot to stop before the shelter, but it’s tough to see what our options are.

A lot of NY shelters don’t have privies, but because there’s a lot of state park land, it looks like they concentrate the bathrooms near day hiker spots. So I hiked off-trail to one of the day hiker spots, but their bathroom was out. I kind of pleaded with them to let me use it anyway (I ran out of shame somewhere outside of Duncannon) but the best they could do was to point me to another outhouse further up the road. In the middle of my frustration, Live Mas showed up at the state park — looks like they’re doing big road miles today.</p>
<p>The backup bathroom was a lot further off trail and was really just a portapotty in an overflow parking lot. Actually, there were two portapotties, one that was out of order and another that had no toilet paper, but I tore off some toilet paper from the out-of-order portapotty and carried it over. Afterwards, I chatted with some locals who are apparently using the area as a music practice spot. By the end of it, we had shared some stories, and I was able to yogi some snacks and water.</p>
<p>Before getting on the trail, I had heard of yogiing, where you use jedi mind tricks to get day hikers to part ways with the snacks or rides that they didn’t plan to offer initially, but are still willing to give. I never imagined I’d develop the skill, but here I am.</p>
<p>I passed the 1400 mile mark. After the halfway point and its artistic mix of rocks and sticks, I was hoping that successive milestones would get more and more extravagant, but we’re back to just rocks now. I went over Bear Mountain, the spot where I had initially planned to meet Teresa and Carter, and it was basically a bunch of stairs. <em>“Bear Mountain? More like Stair Mountain, amirite?”</em> I said to myself. There was a weird detour in the trail that seemed to route away from all water sources, except for an off-trail water spigot that I skipped, in a questionable decision to not sidetrack too much. But it’s still pretty hot out. On top of Bear Mountain, they had these super expensive vending machines, and I paid like $8 for a powerade and an ice cream sandwich.</p>
<p>After the mountain itself was the Bear Mountain Zoo, the lowest elevation of the entire trail. I thought I was so late they might not let me in, but I squeaked by! The zoo is populated largely by injured animals, which seems really cool but also means that the animals aren’t terribly active in their enclosures. I stopped by the bear enclosure, and very true to my AT experience, there weren’t any bears there. I’m probably going to go through this entire trail and only see a single bear cub.</p>
<p>I had arranged to stay at a local motel for the night, as apparently there’s a guy who’s really good at washing socks, which is something I desperately need, ever since trying to wash them myself. He picks me up from the parking lot just outside of the zoo, and he seems nice, but as we’re pulling out, he sees a Hasidic Jew and makes an angry comment about how they’re running the world not paying their taxes. I was so incredibly uncomfortable, and I’m upset with myself for not just getting out of the car. As we kept driving, his conversation shifted to talking about some of the severe flooding that happened in New York last year, apparently by the same storm system that wrecked a good portion of Vermont. He talked about a bridge being washed out and a girl drowning. As he was talking through it, he was narrating his own need to find a target to blame, some cause for why bad things happen to good people. The only potential cause he could put words to was the Chinese, saying that the timing wasn’t too far off from the weather balloon incident. The dude is definitely a bit unhinged, but the more he talked, the more I just felt sorry for him. It must be really tough to need that external “reasons” for things just to make it through the day.</p>
<p>The FarOut comments were right about the socks. He prewashed my socks in a hot water/vinegar solution. They might not feel exactly brand new again, but they’re certainly much better off.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-25">AT Day 84: Fort Montgomery to RPH Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/25/2024</div><div>24.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>1410.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->1434.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="69/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="listen to your body">🤕</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="36/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Some days it feels like I’m just walking from a shelter on the side of one mountain to a different shelter on the side of a different mountain. This morning, I walked over the Hudson River.</p>
<p>One of the New York trail aspects people talk about is deli blazing, where you’re supposed to be able to get all your calories from just visiting a NY deli. This sounds amazing, but I’ve been trying to figure out the logistics a bit — where are the delis? How many are there, and how do I time them right? Today was an exercise in “don’t overthink it”, as the trail literally goes right by a deli called “Appalachian Market”. I was able to order hot food, drink a cold gatorade, and round off my snack collection. I ran into Freedom and Dax while I chilled out for a while.</p>
<p>It’s still hot, but not quite as hot during the day as it was when I was in New Jersey, and I was able to make decent time. I’ve been using the log books to see how far ahead of me people are, and I opened a log book expecting to find a sign-in sheet, but found individual cards instead, and felt compelled to write poetry. I think I said something like,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the universe but dying, <br>
But it’s ours, if only for this moment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or something like that. I tried to remember the inspired thought as I walked away but I don’t think I got it quite right.</p>
<p>Interesting trail magic at RPH shelter from Sparx, a thru hiker who finished the trail a few weeks ago. She’s writing a book about how the politics of division (the division of politics?) is biological, baked into our lower level thinking that seeks to compartmentalize. I ordered a pizza because I could, but there was so much food here, I didn’t manage to finish my side, and ended up giving the rest to a guy named Bridger. The maintainer stopped by and had a question for the group: do they think people are nice? Apparently he asks this question of a lot people, and while most say yes, a fair percentage of people say that others would answer no. I suppose that’s an interesting observation. Sparx thanked him for doing such a good job making RPH such a cool shelter to stay at, and mentioned that she’d like to do more trail magic here, which kicked off a long conversation/disagreement between the two over whether this is ok or not. It seems like the maintainer is more or less saying that doing trail magic at RPH falls into the law of unexpected consequences, and that there’s a significant chance that someone else might do a similar thing but without the good will and intention of cleaning up after themselves, ending up diminishing the things that make RPH a great shelter to begin with. After he left, most of the other hikers were mad at the maintainer, as Sparx’s actions had been well-intentioned and she was responsible about cleaning up after the group. But I think I side with the maintainer: the hikers moving along the trail never get the perspective of seeing how a single place changes with different hikers’ passing.</p>
<p>The privy here smells absolutely terrible, but the artwork and ambiance makes up for it.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-26">AT Day 85: RPH Shelter to Edward R Murrow Park, Pawling, NY</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/26/2024</div><div>17.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>1434.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->1451.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="47/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="16/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p><em>DELI BLAZING IS AMAZING.</em> I was so concerned about the logistics of deli blazing, but it’s pretty simple: every day, plan on having at least one meal at a deli. I don’t know how long it’ll last, but I don’t look a gift deli in the mouth. I had a great late breakfast/early lunch today.</p>
<p>I tried my hand at hitching when I got to Pawling — it went well, except for the fact that my driver took me to the wrong park, and I had to walk from one park in Pawling to the other. Can’t win them all!</p>
<p>This park has two levels: an upper pavilion and a lower pavilion. Word is that, during the extreme flooding last year, the lower pavilion suffered a flash flood. Last year’s rains were definitely extra crazy, but as it was supposed to storm tonight, I decided on the upper pavilion. After getting set up, I headed down to the parking lot and caught up with Beat Box and Beatnik, who had already called a taxi to bring them into town. I hitched along and got some tasty food in town. Just around sundown, I got a text from Beat Box that they had called the taxi to head back.</p>
<p>As I was getting back into my tent, as I was taking off my shoes inside the vestibule, it started to rain, literally in between the time I had closed the rainfly but before I had zipped shut the inner wall. And then the wind began to howl! I could feel the wind catch underneath my tent, and I’m guessing it would have blown away if I had gotten back just 10 minutes later.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-27">AT Day 86: Edward R Murrow Park, Pawling, NY to Schaghticoke Mountain Campsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/27/2024</div><div>18.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1451.9<!-- --> to <!-- -->1470<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="75/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="56/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>Good bye New York! Hello Connecticut (and then hello NY but then hello again CT)!</p>
<p>I started the day off with (hooray) another deli. I made sure to order breakfast and to pack out dinner. The trail today was pretty, both in NY and CT! The trail in every state seems to have a personality, and CT feels a little like glamping, like the trail comes with all the amenities. The rocks have been rounded off, but with a hint still that you’re outdoors and that you’re roughing it. I dunno. The only hard part of the day (and it was a good little challenge) was Schaghticoke Mountain, which was the section of trail that dipped back into NY. We’ll see, maybe CT will have some more hardships up its sleeve around the next bend.</p>
<p>It’s really crazy though to be hiking <em>from Georgia</em> into a state that I’ve always come to in a car. I don’t even know how it’s going to feel when I hit Massachusetts. I’ve always felt like I have this home town advantage, where, from here, I get to hike through MA (my home), VT (my birthplace and home of the LT), NH (where I’ve done most of my hiking), and ME (where I’ve only hiked one mountain, I think? but it was Katahdin and I’ve done it at least twice).</p>
<p>I don’t mean to complain that the trail in Connecticut is a bit more well-to-do than other parts. Hell, I wish northern PA had this kind of budget. One particular benefit I like is that CT has bear boxes and privies at campsites in addition to shelters. Tonight, I stayed at a nice campground, and there was only other couple that came in, the nice couple doing a section that I met last night in Pawling.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-28">AT Day 87: Schaghticoke Mountain Campsite to Cesar Brook Campsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/28/2024</div><div>17.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>1470<!-- --> to <!-- -->1487<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="75/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="68/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I walked into Kent with Beat Box and Beatnik today, and came up close to the other side of well-to-do CT: the prices. I chilled out in a nice bakery/cafe (even if they couldn’t make me an affogato) and packed out a dinner, and one day’s worth of food equated to roughly 4 day’s worth of food in GA. I don’t mind paying a premium for town calories, though, so it’s all good.</p>
<p>I think CT heard me making fun of how glampy it is. I was coming down a little steep rocky sandy section and slipped on a rock. A second later, I had fallen a few feet and landed upside down with my head just a few inches away from a good-sized rock. It happened slowly enough that I was able to brace myself, and so all I have is just a little scratch (both on me as well as one on my pack) but it sure woke me up! I think I also freaked out Beat Box, who saw it happen right in front of him. All’s well though!</p>
<p>Another nice part about CT’s well-to-do-ness: they have little tri-fold handouts at their bulletin boards with information, including who to contact about trail issues. I passed some crazy blowdowns today, and the next time I pass one of those bulletins, I’ll grab that email address again.</p>
<p>CT also has a few of the same old stone walls that I really liked in Vermont. There’s something that I really like about a trail that makes a gap in a stone wall, and reminds me of Robert Frost’s “Mending Wall”. <em>Something there is that doesn’t love a wall, that wants it gone.</em> I want to revisit this when I get to Vermont, and see if I look at its stone walls the same way I did last year.</p>
<p>Tonight’s campsite was a good deal more packed than last night, with pretty much every spot for a tent occupied. There are 4 zones in the campground, and my zone alone is sporting 3 tents. One of the guys in my area, Bandit, was a pretty cool dude to chat with.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-29">AT Day 88: Cesar Brook Campsite to Limestone Spring Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/29/2024</div><div>16.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1487<!-- --> to <!-- -->1503.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="59/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="49/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Last night was another late night peeing fiasco. I woke up with a dire need to pee, but I’d have to walk past around 4 tents to get to the privy, so I tried to walk without turning on my headlamp, but peeing in the middle of the night is also an audible activity. Before long, the woman from the next zone over had turned on her headlamp, as she was probably even <em>more</em> concerned about strange noises that weren’t accompanied by a light in the distance. I had no choice but to turn on my headlamp and walk to the privy. Ugh.</p>
<p>Today was a good day! Good weather, pretty views. At one point in the morning I heard a lot of really loud cars in the distance, and I thought some local car enthusiasts were tearing up some local roads and I might have a hard time crossing the street — turns out, it was a local race track and I was able to get a good view of them from the hill. I stopped at the Mountainside Cafe for brunch with Bandit and Bluegrass, where (!!!) they were able to make me an affogato, even when it wasn’t on the menu. Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Returning to the subject of peeing, when I passed a sign for the 1500 mile mark, I felt compelled to pee next to it, but then I saw some day hikers not far from me, so I hustled on. But shortly thereafter, when I was safe, there was a milestone made of sticks, so I peed in the woods not far from there. With any luck, I’ll be fully feral by the time I finish the trail.</p>
<p>Tonight’s shelter was a steep 0.3 mile drop, which ordinarily would be cause for angst, but the FarOut comments give unanimous praise for the water here, so I’m all for it. I decided to stay in the shelter, (a) because I think I might be out of no-see-um territory, and (b) because I don’t really want to mess with the tent platforms. There are some mosquitos here, but hopefully the rain keeps them away.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-06-30">AT Day 89: Limestone Spring Shelter to Race Brook Falls Campsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>6/30/2024</div><div>14.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>1503.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->1518<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="70/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="65/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>I’m home! In my home state, at least. The shelter worked out pretty well last night! There were some mosquitos, but not too many.</p>
<p>Today I resupplied in Salisbury. The coffee shop had these nice little linen seat cushions, and when I got up to leave, I noticed mine was a bit dirtier than the others. You can’t take me anywhere!</p>
<p>After grabbing groceries, I hung out with Bandit and Bluegrass and other hikers. They were planning to stay for a bit, but I was hoping to get back on trail before long. I got a ride back to the trail from a guy with leather armbands (I think from the local church?). It was threatening to thunderstorm, and he said the upcoming section was exposed and offered to let me stay at his place for a bit. As nice of a gesture as I’m sure that was, I didn’t know him, I didn’t know how far from the trail he was, and I had no desire to be dependent on someone else, so I declined. I get the sense he thought me a bit foolhardy. Sure enough, almost as soon as he pulled away, it started raining. Just a few drops, but big ones. A woman on a bike rode by, saying “it’s a bad day for hiking”, as if I picked today of all days to venture out. The rain started coming down heavier as the trail went into a field, and I ran for the cover of trees. I got my rain gear on, took stock, then hiked a bit, finding a small tree to hunker under. (Never the tallest tree, and never too close to the trunk.) I then walked a little further, resolving not to climb or leave tree cover, and I came across a privy by a trail head. I went in, rearranged my pack and ate a snack, and by the time I came out, the rain had settled down, and I hiked on.</p>
<p>Eating inside a privy is probably adding another hole punch to my feral card, but as I see it, I didn’t touch anything.</p>
<p>Going up Bear Mountain (CT edition) was super easy, but the descent was pretty sketchy, very tough and technical. I kept on trying to figure out, was it going to rain again? Where, when, how much?</p>
<p>Immediately after entering MA, I came up on Sage Ravine, and it’s gorgeous. I’m smitten already. MA trail so far seems a little bit like NH, but a lot like home. Along the way I met some thru hikers who had started in Pawling who said it might not rain after all, and I’d be at the shelter in 90 minutes. I think this bordered on irresponsible advice, but he meant well.</p>
<p>Initially I wanted to get to the first shelter in MA, which falls after 2 peaks. I got to the first peak and took a look around, and the storm clouds looked like they were headed my way. There was a campground in between the peaks, so I settled for that rather than take my chances with the storm. My mom and John would have been proud.</p>
<p>This was the longest “short” day in some time that I can remember — the trail is getting hard again!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-01">AT Day 90: Race Brook Falls Campsite to South Mount Wilcox Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/1/2024</div><div>21.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>1518<!-- --> to <!-- -->1539.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="55/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="44/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>I’m pretty enamored with the trail through Massachusetts so far.

<p>Massachusetts wooed me further with some lovely trail magic today, even if none of their chargers could fit my phone and there was a confused man who seemed to suggest that doing 40 miles a day on the LT was perfectly possible. Nothing’s going to ruin my mood, this is all just lovely.</p>
<p>I was a little slow to snag a tent spot, so it’s me and Hummingbird taking our chances with the mosquitos in the shelter. (Which is also lovely.)

<p>I stopped at a little trail stand kiosk of sorts, a magical box marked “AT Trail Stand” that had snacks and drinks right next to a picnic table. And who do I see while stopping for a little snack lunch, but Brightside and Kachow! What’s more, Live Mas is up ahead outside tonight’s shelter, and is picking up McDonald’s, and is willing to snag me something. Massachusetts, you’re doing alright.</p>
<p>I hiked with them the rest of the way to the shelter, and this has to be the best shelter I’ve ever stayed in, ever. It’s a cabin, with bunks upstairs, a little reading nook downstairs, and a caretaker who’s going to make <em>pancakes</em> in the morning. Also, it’s right next to a beautiful pond, with canoes and everything.</p>

I should have gotten out of bed a little earlier, but it’s hard. The pond was still wonderful, and I had the spot to myself. It was just a really nice spot to slow down. After that, it was time for pancakes. This really is the most wonderful shelter.</p>
<p>I crossed the Mass Pike this morning. I’m so impressed that you can’t hear it from the pond; as loud as any interstate is, it was a blessing to have such peace and quiet; such a contrast from hiking in the mid-Atlantic. At some point, I nearly caught up to Kachow and the rest of the crew, but when I turned a corner, they weren’t there anymore. I caught up to them later around the Cookie Lady of the North (aka Cookie Lady 2.0), it turns out they found a quicker route that bypassed some of the marshlands. I don’t begrudge them a road walk, I guess, if you’re into that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The Cookie Lady gave out some pretty good cookies, but what she <em>really</em> should be known for is that hibiscus lemonade, <em>damn</em>. So good. I tried to make it last, but all good things come to an end eventually.</p>
<p>I hiked out with them and we eventually pulled into the yard of Tom Levardi, a Massachusetts trail angel of sorts who lets hikers tent in his yard. Tom seems like a gift, a fitting emissary of Massachusetts. Dalton is a nice trail town. I ordered an ice cream large enough for pre-trail me to be embarrassed by, but having no shame about ice cream portions is just one of the many perks of being hiker trash. I also made an impulse buy at Cumberland Farms, where they’re selling Mountain Dew in red white and blue for the Fourth. You also get a discount if you buy all 3 colors. Somehow Live Mas and I teamed up on my brain and convinced it to pack out 3 bottles of Mountain Dew; I guess I’ll be enjoying them somewhere on the top of Greylock tomorrow.</p>
<p>John texted me — we had originally planned to hike Dalton to Cheshire tomorrow, but he’s sick. Bummer! After meeting up with Elizabeth and Rachel in GA and Harpers Ferry, I had high hopes for off-trail meetups, but the logistics since then has been abysmal.

<p>I got Dunks in Cheshire — it was all that was open. (Technically I could have stopped by Dollar General where Brightside and crew had stopped, but what kind of self-respecting Bostonian could skip out on Dunks, and on the 4th of July no less?) I grabbed some food (including a questionable Ben &#x26; Jerry’s chunks of cookie dough snack), refilled water, and started the ascent out of town. I tried an aggressive pace that I thought I might be able to keep up all the way to the summit, and it was going so well that I didn’t have the heart to stop and hang out with Live Mas when I saw he was taking a break. I had just enough electrolytes/calories/adrenaline to make it to the summit, all 7.7 miles. First time ever summiting Greylock, and I did it in style, or at the very least, speed.</p>
<p>It turns out that there <em>is</em> a lodge at the summit, so I went and booked a bunk and dinner. I bought myself a brownie and washed it down with some of the tri-color Mountain Dew I had packed out.

<p>Together we caught up over tacos and burritos, and I got to hear how the family is doing while I’ve been gone for the summer. (I asked how things have been going, given that I’ve been disconnected from the world; my mom started talking about current events in the news, and I interrupted to say, no, that’s the part I wanted to ignore, tell me about the things happening to the people I love and care about.) After that, we walked through Big Y to get a resupply in, and pack out a deli sandwich for tonight’s dinner. After resupplying, we did some gear swaps. It’s finally time to retire the BeFree and give Sawyer Squeeze a try. My mom also got me a lollipop with a mouflon on top!</p>
<p>Finally, we drove back to the trailhead to say goodbye. After hugs and well-wishes, my mom got back into the car, and I saw her put her head in her hands and cry as I walked away. The whole time we hung out, it was just a normal day, no emotion on display, and I can only imagine that was my mom’s intent, to make this a low-key fun day; the flip side of that is that I’m not really sure what emotions my mom is feeling, or has been feeling.</p>
<p>The hike out of North Adams was pretty straightforward, and it got me probably about as close if not closer to Vermont as where I was when I started the Long Trail last year. And in that last stretch, I passed another milestone of 1600 miles. Tomorrow morning, another milestone of getting into Vermont. It’ll be kind of cool to chat with some end-to-enders.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-06">AT Day 95: Sherman Brook Campsite to Goddard Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/6/2024</div><div>26.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>1601.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->1628.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="49/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="23/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>It took me 2 days last year to get as far as I got today. At my first shelter last year, I remember hearing AT thru hikers talking about hiking 20+ mile days, and here I am, just doing it.</p>
<p>This morning was a little disgusting. It started raining just as I was putting away my tent, and it was coming down pretty hard by the time I left camp. There was a bad weather bypass on the first climb, and I considered it for a moment, but pressed on. It calmed down a bit by the time I hit the Vermont border, enough for me to grab a snack and enjoy a break. Strong memories of the last time I was here!</p>
<p>I have a new friend: the little stuffed animal that came with the lollipop fits nicely on my pack, and I’ve decided to give him a trail name. His tag says “Bucky”, but henceforth he shall be known as Snitches, given his stitches. He was pretty brave through the rain this morning!</p>
<p>It cleared up in the middle of the day, and I grabbed some lunch at the same shelter where I finished the day last year. I passed some LT hikers doing their first or second day, on top of Harmon Hill. I didn’t know what to say to them; I wanted to say “you’re in for such a wild ride, I’m so excited for you, you have no idea who I am etc” but all I could say was good luck. That’s probably all that needs saying.</p>
<p>Shortly after crossing Rt 9, I noticed that one of my trekking pole tips came loose, so I finished the day with a single trekking pole. I think I should be able to get that solved in Manchester Center. The clouds came back shortly after, just as I took a breather at Melville Nauheim. Somehow, Smokey, a guy I had lunch with just once at my first shelter in NJ, recognized me. Small trail! I couldn’t help but say, that was the third time I’ve ever visited Melville Nauheim, and it’s rained each time.</p>
<p>The rain let up for a bit and I was able to press on to Goddard Shelter, even if it felt like I was playing chicken with the storm clouds toward the end. I picked a tent spot right next to where I was last year.</p>
<p>It’s a bit surreal, revisiting all these spots again. It’s good to be back in Vermont!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-07">AT Day 96: Goddard Shelter to Spruce Peak Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/7/2024</div><div>27.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>1628.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->1655.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="66/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="52/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>I was amazed with how much less mud there is on trail vs. this part of the trail last year!

But today, I went through my old friend, the Lye Brook Wilderness, and it was such a breeze.</p>
<p>Right before Lye Brook is Stratton, and I’m SO GLAD I got here on a good day. I finally had a chance to get views from the fire tower! I also managed to stop at Prospect Rock, a spot I had walked right by last year. In the spirit of taking the time, I went and checked it out, and I’m glad I did.</p>
<p>I finished today at Spruce Peak; for the second day in a row, I covered in one day what took me two days last year.

There was a couple in the parking lot about to leave, and while they weren’t headed into Manchester Center, they were willing to drop me off given how close it was.</p>
<p>I got two things squared away at the outfitter’s: I exchanged my favorite pair of socks (the same socks I had bought from the same outfitter last year on the LT) for a brand new pair of Darn Toughs, and I got a replacement tip for my trekking pole. They even attached it for me, which looks like it might have been a bit tricky to do. I’m going to miss that pair of socks, but I’m not going to miss having holes in the bottom of them.</p>
<p>I grabbed breakfast alongside a section hiker at Up For Breakfast (maybe named because it’s on the 2nd floor?). He asked the waitress if they carried Vermont maple syrup, and she replied it’s the only syrup they have. Of course it is. ❤️</p>
<p>I mostly hung out at the same places I enjoyed last year, including the same cafe (no affogato, sadly), but eventually it was time to get back on the trail. I got a relatively easy hitch back, and proceeded to attack Bromley. I checked out the lookout tower (which I think is new? it was definitely too foggy last year for sure to see anything), and, of course, ran into Live Mas. We hiked together for a while over the next two peaks until Live Mas had to take care of something and I kept going. I think they’re planning on heading to Lost Pond Shelter tonight. Originally, I had crazy ideas of making it as far as Little Rock Pond or maybe just Big Branch, but I don’t think I have it in me. I ended up stopping at Griffith Lake, mostly because it’s supposed to be a really pretty spot but also because they have tenting platforms, and I want to experiment with the fishbone tent anchors my mom brought for me.</p>
<p>Update: this would have been a great spot were it not for the mosquitos. Still nice, though.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-09">AT Day 98: Griffith Lake to Clarendon Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/9/2024</div><div>22.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>1668.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->1691.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="76/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="68/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today felt a little slower, maybe a little hotter, than some other days, but I made a good detour.

I had some good milestones today! 500 miles from Katahdin, and I passed the 1700 mile mark. But ultimately, today was really hard.</p>
<p>I got wet coming over Killington. There was a thru hiker I met in northern MA (I forgot her name, but she kindly lent me some water when a shelter’s water source was far away and a trickle to boot) who caught up to me while I was having a breakfast snack at Governor Clement. I caught up to her on the way up Killington, and we got up to the top together. We were trying to go fast, as we didn’t want to get caught in bad weather. We made it a pretty long way before it started raining hard, but the mountain is bigger than I remembered, and it was a bit anxiety inducing. By the time we got to the top, though, it seemed pretty safe to go down the other side. I stopped at the summit to refill on water, and she went on ahead.</p>
<p>I was pretty set on finishing the day at the Inn at the Long Trail. Last year, I got there early to make sure I got a spot. For whatever reason this year, I didn’t think I’d need to get there so early. I’m an idiot; when it’s raining outside, inns fill up. When I pulled in around 3:30pm, they were all out of vacancies.</p>
<p>I just spent a good chunk of my morning thinking about all the things I was going to do when I got to a nice room at the inn, and now I have to stay in my dirty wet clothes for I’m not sure how long. I’ve been experimenting with being comfortable being uncomfortable, rearranging my expectations about hygiene when I can’t take a shower every day, but right now I just feel slovenly. Whatever invisible line I’m searching for between living in society and living like an animal, I think I passed it, and now I’m just upset and sad.</p>
<p>I was able to set up my tent across the street from the Inn for free, at least, so it’s not all bad. But I don’t think I’m going to have time to do laundry or be able to take a shower, and now that it’s in my mind that I need one, I feel like I’m in a deficit right now.</p>
<p>I took the shuttle to Rutland and got my resupply in, but realized I had missed the last easy shuttle back. Luckily, these two LT hikers I had met on the shuttle made the same mistake, and had called an Uber. There was some stress as none of the Ubers were picking up our request, but it worked out in the end. (Also, I saw Brightside leaving Walmart right as we were getting picked up, I guess they’re staying at the Yellow Deli?)</p>
<p>Tonight was a nice night: the two LT hikers I had met were both playing guitar in the lounge, and I joined them on the piano. (I had been looking forward to this piano since before setting out.) After that, we shared dinner, and I’m excited for these guys to set out toward Canada.</p>
<p>I’ve had Robert Frost on the brain lately. I’ve crossed the same stone walls that inspired me last year, and today, at Maine Junction, two roads diverged in a wood. Last year, I took the road less traveled, but today, I took a right turn. But though I’m taking the road <em>more</em> traveled, this is where I diverge from the path I’ve taken before. I’ve gotten some comfort from walking along familiar miles, and tomorrow, I’m leaving the familiar behind. I’m a little nervous, but north is the one direction that points home.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-11">AT Day 100: Inn at the Long Trail to Winturri Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/11/2024</div><div>17.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>1710.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->1728.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="37/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="24/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I had a bit of a hard time enjoying myself today. I’m still a little anxious from yesterday, and I didn’t sleep terribly well right next to the road. At least I started with a nice breakfast. Early in the morning, there was a really nice pond, and part of me wanted to stay forever, and an anxious part of me wanted to <em>go</em>. I stopped at a waterfall, and found the girl I had hiked over Killington with, having a town day with her boyfriend. (Us thru hikers, still out on the trail even on town days.) I took a photo of them together on her camera, and she took a photo of me on mine, and I was on my way again.</p>
<p>At a road crossing, I came up on Kachow, Live Mas, Brightside, and Grave Digger as they were taking a break. I basically walked with them for most of the day after that. It’s weird: I remember coming out of Pearisburg, we stayed at a shelter with a tramily that basically made fun of these guys for being in denial of their tramily-hood. Now, they’re a solid unit, and while I don’t know if I ever felt like I was “inside” the circle with these guys, I feel a bit more outside now. I’ve made a lot of my own choices on trail, and I think those choices added up together mean that I’ll probably never have a tramily on the AT. I guess that’s ok.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-12">AT Day 101: Winturri Shelter to Happy Hill Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/12/2024</div><div>21.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1728.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->1749.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="58/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="46/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>My life was improved this morning by a visit to a cafe. They had an affogato right on the menu (!), though it was a creemee, which was a bit weird.</p>
<p>I hiked on and off with Kachow, Live Mas, Brightside, and Grave Digger, but we got spread out at times and there were a few times where they did a bit of opportunistic yellow blazing.</p>
<p>I really like something I did song-wise! I’ve been bouncing back and forth on this Robert Frost / “Mending Wall” idea, “something there is that doesn’t love a wall” etc, and I think I have a chorus for it. This kind of “Gorbachev, tear down this wall” idea, where maybe the things that unite us are stronger than the things that divide us: “maybe we belong on the same side / good fences don’t exist inside or outside the mind”. I sat down and recorded me humming it a bit while taking a break to refill water. It’s probably a weird combination of lack of sleep as well as being overwhelmed with completeness of an idea coming/fitting together, but I was tearing up a bit as I was going through it. Walking by/through stone walls during the course of the day just kind of reinforced the idea. I hope I like it as much later as I do now.</p>
<p>We finished off the day at Happy Hill Shelter. There’s a trio that came in after us: Chappy, Red Maple, and Hawaii. They ended up chatting with Live Mas for a while, and I ended up gifting Chappy a Starbucks Via packet that’s probably been in my pack since Georgia. Tomorrow, we’ll all cross into NH, and I’ll say goodbye to Vermont again.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-13">AT Day 102: Happy Hill Shelter to Velvet Rocks Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/13/2024</div><div>7.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>1749.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->1756.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="67/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="focus on sleep quality">🥱</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="43/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>I’m in NH! Today was pretty much a nero, and in some ways it was great, in other ways less so. Thumbs up over all, though.</p>
<p>The border VT/NH border is on a bridge, and it took me like 5 or 10 minutes to find the part of the bridge that actually says “VT/NH”. I ended up googling for pictures of the bridge by thru hikers just so I could figure out what to look for; finally, I found the one particular piece of concrete that actually beared the “VT/NH” mark. And now, I’m in New Hampshire!</p>
<p>I wasn’t really tracking before today that the trail enters NH basically at Dartmouth College, but it does. Hanover NH is basically a college town, and feels a lot like it, even in July when I’m guessing most college kids are out. It also feels like somewhat of a ritzy college town, with some upscale fast casual dining options. I tried a bunch of them. I also scored a free donut! as there’s one spot that gives out free donuts to AT thru hikers. I’ll take trail magic anywhere I can get it.</p>
<p>One thing I was looking forward to was getting a shower, which is supposed to be pretty easy to do at the Rec Center. But apparently it’s only open on weekdays, and today’s a Saturday… meaning that I wouldn’t even be able to come back and get one tomorrow. Bummer.</p>
<p>Hanover does however have this cool chalk art, showing the path out of Vermont and to Katahdin, that just made everything real all over again. Sometimes milestones don’t feel all that special, and other times, something like this chalk art reminds me that, hey, this is a concrete (no pun intended) step toward being closer to my goal. So, I’m in NH now. Woo!</p>
<p>I did a repeat of my Palmerton trick, where I set up my tent in the afternoon and then went back into town sans pack. Not before taking a nap, though. It wasn’t nearly long enough, but I’m really trying to get enough sleep.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-14">AT Day 103: Velvet Rocks Shelter to Smarts Mountain Fire Warden&#x27;s Cabin</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/14/2024</div><div>21.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>1756.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->1778.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="55/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="37/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>20 miles in NH!

Though I guess there won’t be anything taller than Smarts until Moosilauke. I met a woman at a water crossing who wished me dry weather all through the Whites; I wished her no mud through Vermont. I hope we both get our wish granted.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the day, I was debating with myself where I should end up, when I noticed you could camp at this pond. The FarOut comments were a little confusing and contradictory, and while I was scoping it out, I was afraid I was going to have to settle for a really terrible spot; but then, I heard some voices and followed them around a downed tree to find a beautiful clearing, and now I’m tenting right next to a beautiful pond, watching loons dance across it.</p>
<p>I finally understand why loons are named as such, as they really do sound a bit on the crazy side.</p>
<p>It’s really amazing how just the right turn of events can lift a mood.

<p>I lingered for a few minutes at the summit, but there wasn’t anyone that I recognized, so I pressed on. The descent was mildly terrifying. It was pretty steep, with the occasional bolted on wooden step to keep you from dying, and all of this right next to a waterfall that stretched pretty much the entirety of the mountain. I made it to the shelter just ahead of a thunderstorm; for the last hour or so, it seemed to be threatening, and when it finally hit, it really hit. I was eating dinner at the foot of the shelter next to Chappy and co., and the storm went from 0 to 60 in a minute or so. I got soaked just trying to put my ursack in the bear box! I had put my tent up at the edge of a group tenting area, trying to leave room for another couple who were right behind me, but they ended up taking a different spot, and so my tent was unnecessarily more susceptible to soakage than necessary.

Chatting with some folks in the shelter last night, I  thought I might be able to make it to the 11am pickup, but that definitely didn’t happen. Funny how I felt more anxiety this morning about getting out just after 7:30am than I felt in Georgia about getting started by 10am. But I’ve got a shuttle to catch, and the Kinsmans in between, so it’s a bit more challenging.</p>
<p>The Kinsmans were a bit more challenging. There was one moment where, as I was stepping from one boulder to another, I realized I had stepped on one of my shoelaces; luckily, it came free before I lost my balance and fell off the boulder. I passed Chappy and friends at South Kinsman while they were taking a snack break. The peak was solidly in the clouds, but the clouds had moved on by the time I got to North Kinsman, and the views were really pretty. Definitely loving the Whites so far. I also got to my first hut, at Lonesome Lake; I don’t know that I’ll stay in one of these, but it was a nice stop along the way (they have baked goods! and soup!), and the lake itself was beautiful. There was a French-speaking family swimming in the lake that I’m guessing had decide to come to NH as tourists. Prettier than Boston, for sure!</p>
<p>I got to the Flume Gorge visitor center/parking lot by around 2:30pm, well in time for the 4:50pm pickup, but I couldn’t pick up a signal in order to text them. Chappy and friends arrived a little bit after me, but they were planning to resupply and then get back out; they tried hitching, and while it’s probably a challenging spot to hitch, it might be easier for 3 women than for me. I tried to hitch for all of a few minutes but decided it wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p>Waffles and Hawkeye, a father/son duo who are vlogging their thru, arrived a little later, and with a little difficulty, we got a text through and arranged a pickup. Interestingly, the shuttle driver was a guy I recognized from some NH hiking facebook groups as a guy who does handstands on top of Washington more or less every day. Funny, I never gave much thought into how you could arrange that much time off and still get fed, but a shuttle driver job for a hostel in the middle of the Whites is probably a good way to do it.</p>
<p>Having learned from my bunk experience in Tennessee and my tent experience at the Inn at the Long Trail, I paid a bit extra for a private space, but I think I messed up. The space includes an upstairs loft area with beds, but it gets so hot up there that the hostel owner suggested sleeping in the downstairs area on a cot. I also had to spend time trying to dry out my tent, plus I still have plenty of nervous energy just floating about.</p>
<p>I really struggle with when to take a zero. I took one in Damascus, and I plan to take one at Shaw’s in Maine, but my rubric right now for zeroing is basically, will the spot give me joy, with other people who give me joy? I don’t know if this is the right way of looking at it, but I don’t know anyone else at the hostel and this cot isn’t giving me joy, so back on the trail tomorrow I go.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize this when I booked the hostel, but this is the hostel where Meg participated in a panel talk on being a solo female thru hiker! There was a series of posters on the bathroom wall for fireside chats at the hostel, and hers was one of them. Pretty cool! I’m glad I was able to stay here.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-18">AT Day 107: The Notch Hostel to Garfield Ridge Campsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/18/2024</div><div>10.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1824.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->1834.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="37/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="20/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY. I’ve told a bunch of people that, if there’s one spot you want to hit on a nice day, it’s Franconia Ridge, and <em>I DID IT</em>. Thank you, oh wonderful south-bounder who blessed me with good weather throughout the Whites!</p>
<p>I started off today in a bit of an over-emotional mess; I just have too many emotions and not enough sleep to manage them all. But I took my time today, and enjoyed every moment. I asked Red Maple to take a photo of me on the ridge, half profile, so that I get a photo of Snitches sitting on top of my pack. In my mind, it’s Snitches that’s carrying me down the trail, not the other way around.</p>
<p>I had a really fortuitous moment of trail provision today on the ridge: Hawkeye (the son in the father/son duo) picked up my tent footprint after I had apparently dislodged it from my pack while putting on a layer. That kid is alright. I don’t want to think about what might have happened if I lost it, and the chances would have been high considering how windy it is on the ridge.</p>
<p>I’m glad I took the time in Vermont to try my hand at setting up my tent on a platform. Garfield Ridge campsite is more or less all tent platforms, and I had to share one with 3 other tents. It was nice to already have at least some picture as to how to set up on it. The X-Mid does take up a lot of space, though; I’m really glad I didn’t get a 2-person, it would have been a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>The AMC apparently has a thru-hiker program where you can get discounts on hut food for staying at the campsites. I’m a sucker for all things food, so I’m in. I had to pay $10 to stay at the campsite (which is already less than the $15 for day hikers), but it’ll be $5 for other campsites along the way. Nice!</p>
<p>By the start of the blue blaze to the campsite, there’s a small set of stairs up a boulder that leads to a bench sitting at an overlook. It was crowded when I arrived, but I had it to myself for a little bit toward sunset. It’s just so peaceful here. I’m glad I didn’t try to press on to another campsite; this site is doing good things for my brain.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-19">AT Day 108: Garfield Ridge Campsite to Ethan Pond Campsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/19/2024</div><div>14.6<!-- --> miles</div><div>1834.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->1848.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="48/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->😐</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="26/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I felt pretty tired and weak today. I definitely didn’t sleep super well last night (surprise surprise), and the descent down Garfield was hair raising. Kind of like the descent down Moosilauke the other day, except maybe a bit less steep, and instead of being next to a waterfall, the trail itself was practically a waterfall, which required a lot of caution. Which would have been no problem if I had gotten enough sleep last night, but ah well.</p>
<p>I left this morning thinking that I might need to do big miles, because the itineraries I’m looking at seem a bit confusing. All of the itineraries I’ve been looking at had me stopping at Garfield last night and Ethan Pond tonight, but the 18 mile plan has me hiking 20 miles from Gorham to Gorham a few days out, and that makes 0 sense. I think it might be a misprint? so I thought it might make sense for me to try to get to Mitzpah Hut tonight. But I did the calculations in my head: that’d be ~24 miles, or 12 hours at 2 miles per hour.</p>
<p>I passed a few people who had stealth camped after Garfield, including Beat Box; I told him as I walked by that I was gonna hike 24 miles today, and he gave me some encouragement, but I realized within a few hours that it wasn’t going to happen. It didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Abandoning the Mitzpah plan enabled me to stop at huts along the way, so it’s good that I realized relatively quickly that Mitzpah wouldn’t happen. I grabbed some breakfast and baked goods at Galehead hut, and then stopped again at the Zealand Falls hut.</p>
<p>Last year, a week or so after I finished the LT, I went on a hike with Meg to scope out some stealth camp spots she was curious about. The hike was along the AT, and pretty flat, and I remember thinking that maybe the NH section of the AT might not be so bad. That hike was basically the section of trail between Zealand Falls and Ethan Pond, and as it turns out, <em>it’s the only section of flat trail in NH I’ve come across</em>. It was nice though to hike through this section again, and relive the memory of familiar trail.</p>
<p>I pulled into camp around 3:30pm and got my camp chores out of the way. I chilled out by the pond (I’m listening to the audiobook for <em>The Comfort Crisis</em>, as recommended by Rabbit), and the AMC campsites are earning their $5 without a doubt. It’s still super early, but I’m going to turn in, and see if I can claw back some of the sleep I’ve been missing out on.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-20">AT Day 109: Ethan Pond Campsite to Lake of the Clouds Hut</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/20/2024</div><div>14.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>1848.9<!-- --> to <!-- -->1862.9<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Building">🏠</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="87/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good sleep last night">😃</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="61/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>SLEEP ACQUIRED. There was a tiny mishap last night as some dude arrived to camp after dark and set up at the same tent platform I was at, but I was able to get back to sleep, and I slept so well. Which led to a good day of hiking!</p>
<p>I hit my first NH trail magic spot at Crawford Notch, though the dude giving it out was a bit hard to peg. I introduced myself as Marathon, and he replied that this was a “trail name-free zone”; <em>ok, I guess you just won’t know who I am, I guess</em>. But the homemade stew was very welcomed, and I appreciated him coming out.</p>
<p>The climb after Carter Notch was cool! I had some good views looking out over Carter Notch, and it’s always so cool to see the road I had just crossed a few hours before.</p>
<p>I stopped at Mitzpah Hut for lunch, and made it to Lake of the Clouds Hut by around ~3:15pm. I asked about Work For Stay, and they told me to ask again in a few hours; Java (who I had met at Garfield Ridge campsite) had booked me a spot in the dungeon, but I was able to get that changed to WFS when the spots opened up.</p>
<p>Work For Stay was a bit weird. It’s supposed to be only for thru hikers, but I think that the other hikers doing WFS were only overnight hikers. Also, there was a number of hikers that paid the $10 for a spot in the dungeon, but were allowed to sleep on the dining room floor instead, so the floor was a bit crowded. There wasn’t much in the way of dinner leftovers either, maybe because of people coming out for tomorrow’s Seek the Peak fundraiser, so I didn’t get a big dinner. But altogether the experience of doing WFS was cool, and the barter mentality sits well with me.</p>
<p>It didn’t sit well for everybody. The guys hiking with Beat Box are a group of southern boys, and NH is rubbing them the wrong way. I got into a slightly heated debate with a dude about the AMC, who doesn’t believe he should ever have to pay to camp on federally protected land, but I think they’re probably also running up against some good old fashioned New England style classicism. On one hand, I think they’re absolutely justified to feel the way they feel, and it sucks; on the other, I think they’re passing judgment on a section of the trail that they don’t understand. I remember writing off the Smokies as “thanks for the $40, here’s your tarp” but I think there’s something dangerous about this tourist mentality of a thru hiker, walking through cultures without being part of them. I remember Live Mas defending the Smokies with historical context, I wonder if he felt at all defensive like I did tonight?</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-21">AT Day 110: Lake of the Clouds Hut to Osgood Tentsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/21/2024</div><div>10.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>1862.9<!-- --> to <!-- -->1873<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="62/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="ready for the day">😎</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="52/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>I went up and over Washington this morning! I stayed at LotC until just before 9am for free breakfast leftovers, then ate SO MUCH at Mt Washington visitors center. I got there before 10am, but they didn’t start serving pizza/lunch until later, so I ended up going back for multiple meals. I don’t even want to know how much I paid. It was windy, cloudy, and a bit rainy when I first arrived, but the clouds cleared up after a meal or two, so I went out and got my summit photo a second time. I also texted with Ted, and he said he’d come pick me up from Katahdin! Logistics win!</p>
<p>I remember going up Clingmans Dome and thinking, “this is so easy, wait until we get to Mount Washington!” but this morning was by far the easiest ascent up Mount Washington I’ve experienced. It helps a lot that it was only a mile and a half. That was the easy part; the rest of the day was basically a long descent, punctuated by lesser Presidentials.</p>
<p>Today was the Seek the Peak fundraiser, so the trail was <em>crowded</em>. The AT avoids the actual peaks for most of the Presis, and I’m kind of glad it does, as the peak bypass sections of the trail were far less crowded. I’m glad that folks are getting out here on the trail for their weekend, but the amount of stop-and-go action around the Presis got to be a bit brutal. It was also basically just 7 miles of fairly dangerous rockstacles (rock obstacles? going with it), so most of the day hikers were taking their time, rightly so, and I didn’t want to just breeze past them.</p>
<p>Also, did I mention that this section of trail is tough?! This was a long 10 miles. I remember though hiking a section last year close to Mount Adams on a MITOC day hike, and telling hikers that I too planned to hike the AT soon enough. Now here I am.</p>
<p>I took a breather at the Madison Spring Hut, to grab some lemonade and sit down with some other thru hikers. A southbounder was telling a story about how he had hiked all day to get to Pinkham Notch, only to arrive at the visitors center who told him he wasn’t allowed to camp there. When he asked where he could camp, they said he had to hike a half mile back north, which he didn’t want to do, so he stealth camped just on the other side of the highway. Someone else was empathetic, but I found myself siding completely with the visitors center and getting frustrated with him. Maybe yesterday’s conversation bled into my feelings a bit too, but this just feels like thru-hiker entitlement; it doesn’t really matter how far he hiked that day, or how far he has to climb to reach a camping area, the rules were written before he arrived and he doesn’t have much of a right to be upset. But as I found myself getting upset, I excused myself and headed back to the trail.</p>
<p>After getting up Madison and down below treeline, the last 1.5 miles were a pretty steep descent. Java arrived a bit before me, and Waffles and Hawkeye arrived a bit after. I think the day really took it out of them. I could tell they were a little frustrated, and I couldn’t imagine hiking a trail this long with my parents. So many opportunities to get into huge fights and not much space away from them to help mitigate. My heart goes out to them.</p>
<p>I figured out why Gorham is on the 18 mile/day itinerary twice: you can get there either via Rt 16 or via Rt 2, and it’s ~20 miles between the two highways. Tomorrow, I’m planning to get into Gorham at Rt 16, maybe with Waffles and Hawkeye. We’ll see what tomorrow brings. Long day, legs are tired, sleep now.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-22">AT Day 111: Osgood Tentsite to Wildcat River Stealth Tentsite</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/22/2024</div><div>10.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>1873<!-- --> to <!-- -->1883.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="76/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="balance stress and recovery">🫠</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="58/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>The trail provides! Initially I planned to shuttle into Gorham with Java and Stumbles, but when we (me, Beat Box, and the guy who doesn’t like the AMC) got to the base of the mountain, we met a trail angel/fan of Waffles’/Hawkeye’s YouTube channel who had agreed to give them a ride into town. He said he had enough room for the rest of us too, so I scored a free ride!</p>
<p>While we were waiting for Waffles and Hawkeye to come down the mountain, we grabbed some breakfast at the Pinkham Notch visitors center. This was another spot that I think I’ve been to before. They have some old photos of the AMC huts back when they were new, and some of them pre-date the AT itself. I think this helped give some perspective that the AMC isn’t just capitalizing on federal land; instead, they took on the task of making these trails and building the huts far before the trail started getting the yearly AT traffic it does today, and they look after the land through a somewhat complex relationship with the government (at least, complex to me). He’s still not sure how he feels about paying to stay on federal land, but I think he realizes now that it wasn’t quite as simple as he originally made it out to be.</p>
<p>Waffles and Hawkeye caught up to us shortly after breakfast, and we caught a ride into Gorham with the trail angel. We stopped to let Beat Box and friends out at the hostel they were staying at, and the trail angel gave us all some homemade blueberry pie to enjoy, topped with locally picked blueberries. He didn’t have any plates, but my hand did just fine, even if it was a bit sticky.</p>
<p>There’s a dynamic I don’t quite understand around trail angels and trail vloggers. Waffles and Hawkeye are documenting their thru, and people like this trail angel are living vicariously through their videos, and in turn become kind of a fan base. The trail angel had brought a kind of sumptuous feast for them, including lobster rolls which can’t be all that cheap in NH, and thanked them repeatedly for what they do. I think what he means by that is first and foremost the hard work of hiking the AT, but I think what he really means is the work of documenting their hike and making it accessible. I gave up posting even photos of the trail on social media; it felt performative, and took energy away from the direct experience of being on trail and away from society. There’s a part of this dynamic that feels wrong to me, but it’s also an act of bartering: trading lobster rolls for an insight into the lived experience of trail life. I couldn’t ever partake in either side of this, but I think I empathize with it a bit more now.</p>
<p>The trail angel was very giving of his time, and I walked a thin line around yogiing a trip to Walmart and a ride back to the trailhead. I spent about 3 hours off trail, but if it weren’t for this trail angel, it would have been the better part of the day, and I’m extremely grateful.</p>
<p>The climb out of Pinkham Notch was about as steep as the descent into it, but my legs got up Wildcat just fine. I was kind of hoping to get another Work For Stay at Carter Notch hut, so I powered through and passed some guys at the gondola without stopping for longer than it took to eat a single clif bar. It turned out that some south-bounders snagged WFS before I could (of course), but the croo had a good suggestion on a stealth spot just outside of where the Forest Protection Area ends. I found a good tent spot and had some time to chill before bed, so I checked out “the remnants” on the advice of one of the other hikers. Apparently, Carter Dome, which is now rounded off, used to have a more angular peak, but the top of the mountain broke off years and years ago, and you can still see the remnants of that as a series of boulders at the base of the mountain.</p>
<p>After I turned in for the night, I heard Chappy, Hawaii, and Red Maple arrive at the stealth spot. They somehow managed to find spots for 3 tents in an area where there really wasn’t any great spots to be had. They might not always be quiet when they get into camp late, but I’ll definitely grant them some ingenuity in making the best out of a less than stellar campsite.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-23">AT Day 112: Wildcat River Stealth Tentsite to Rattle River Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/23/2024</div><div>13.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>1883.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->1897<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="no record">🤷</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="recovery in progress">🙂‍↕️</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->😐</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="57/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>On one hand, I confirmed this morning that my bathtub is leaking, after last night’s rain.

We’ll see what they say.</p>
<p>Before setting out, I spent the early morning grabbing breakfast and drying out my tent at the hut. I also spoke with the croo a bit, and learned (a) the croo at the first hut for NOBOs is apparently mean to <em>everybody</em>, not just the southern boys, and (b) the ascent up Wildcat has the steepest mile for northbounders anywhere on the AT. That was cool to learn.</p>
<p>At 10am, today was one of my later starts, but it was probably worth it to get breakfast and dry out a bit, and I don’t think I would have gone any further had I started much earlier. Today was my last day in the Whites, and I <em>almost</em> made it through unscathed from wet weather. While last night was a proper hard rain, today was a classic New England rain, just wet all day long.</p>
<p>I passed Java and Stumbles going southbound on one of the Carters — they didn’t want to go up Wildcat in wet weather (maybe they already knew how steep it was?). They were planning to make it to Carter Notch Hut, I hope they make it!</p>
<p>Tonight for dinner, I realized I had miscounted ramen packets during my hasty shopping trip to Walmart, and I ate a lonesome tuna packet for dinner. Definitely getting food in Gorham tomorrow.</p>
<p>Chappy, Red Maple, and Hawaii are back at the shelter tonight, and I can hear them from my tent. Definitely too high energy for me tonight.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-24">AT Day 113: Rattle River Shelter to Gentian Pond Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/24/2024</div><div>13.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>1897<!-- --> to <!-- -->1910.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="49/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="25/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>At the shelter in the morning, I met Apparition, who had arranged a shuttle into town and agreed to split it with me. After a pretty quick 2 mile hike down to the road (the only other easy section of trail in NH so far), I piggybacked off his shuttle and headed back to the Gorham Walmart, apparently the last Walmart of the entire trail. After resupplying, I hitched to McDonald’s without even asking, then shuttled back at 11:15am.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was more or less covered by mist, and I can almost feel the White Mountains giving way to Maine. I’m less than 5 miles away from the Maine border. There’s a part of me that can’t believe it, but there’s an equal part of me that feels like it’s inevitable.</p>
<p>At the shelter tonight (I think I might be far enough north to avoid some mosquitos?), I met Ovenbird and Songbird, who are also from Mass. Ovenbird is named so because there’s an actual bird called an ovenbird (TIL), and its cry of “teacherteacherteacher” matches Ovenbird’s occupation. Songbird’s trailname comes from being a singer, and as it turns out, we share some of the same places in our past; she seems to be more embedded in the Cambridge music scene (Lizard Lounge et al) now than I was when I lived there. She’s carrying a guitalele (a 6-string guitar/ukelele hybrid), which is kind of amazing — I had thought about carrying a cheap uke and had given up, but carrying something twice as large all the way to Maine is pretty damn impressive.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-25">AT Day 114: Gentian Pond Shelter to Full Goose Shelter</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/25/2024</div><div>9.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>1910.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->1920.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="51/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="30/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I’m in Maine!

<p>I made it to the shelter fairly early, but I didn’t want to go through Mahoosuc Notch at the end of the day (who knows how long it would take), so I laid up at the last shelter. I talked to some southbounders about the Hundred Mile Wilderness — I guess, while you can work out food caches ahead of time (some kind of thru hiker DoorDash but for resupply), coordinating it was pretty hard, or at least, it was a pain in the ass for these people.</p>
<p>Songbird and Ovenbird ended up tenting in the same area tonight. I sang along with Songbird to Fiona Apple’s “Paper Bag” and the Mamas and Papas’ “100 Miles” while she played the guitalele. God bless her for putting up with my harmonies, my voice is terribly out of shape and I barely remember these songs but we made it work.

And up Mahoosuc Arm. The notch, which is only a mile long, took me about an hour and 45 minutes. I definitely didn’t speedrun it; it was a big jungle gym, and I took my time and savored it. I was a little nervous about Songbird and Ovenbird, though. I told them this morning that I was aiming for Baldpate Lean-to and hoped I might see them there — Songbird said she wasn’t sure how far they’d get, and they might just aim for Bethel. I can’t imagine it’d be that easy to carry a guitalele through here, but they’ve managed to get it to Maine in the first place, so they probably know what they’re doing.</p>
<p>The arm was a fun ascent — I’ve heard it’s really challenging for southbounders, maybe similar to how it felt to descent Moosilauke for me. The ascent though felt like a slightly less difficult Wildcat.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Arm was Speck Pond, which was really pretty. There’s an AMC shelter there, the last one of the trail, but I kept going. A little while later in the afternoon, I could hear someone coming up behind me, so I pulled off to the side, only to see that it was Bonk, of all people. I don’t think I’ve seen Bonk and DK since… Warwick, maybe? It’s been a hot minute. We all ended up at Baldpate Lean-to. There were some nice older local guys staying in the shelter, and I chatted them up.

<p>The Baldpates were really nice, and <em>unbelievably</em> steep in places. I’ve grown a little accustomed to judging how long it will take to hike to a place on the horizon, based on how far away it looks; I vastly overshot the amount of time it would take to get from Baldpate West Peak to the taller Baldpate East Peak, largely because the trail just goes straight down and straight up. None of this switchback crap, I just walked down one mountain and up another in less than 30 minutes. To be honest though, I could deal with a little bit less adrenaline and a few more switchbacks.</p>
<p>One thing I’m definitely appreciating though is how Maine tends the trail. I didn’t really have much of an understanding of different trail maintenance organizations before coming out on the AT. I realized a few things though while being out here: northern PA sucked, Bear Mountain in NY shouldn’t have replaced a mountain with a set of stairs, and now, the Maine Appalachian Trail Club is finding a balance between kindness and ruggedness. I always thought I appreciated the “natural” ascents and descents of VT and NH, where a hill will have rocks arranged as if they had naturally been deposited there by a glacier thousands of years ago, at just the right distance away from each other. Maine has some places where the rocks are clearly placed by human hands, not by Mother Nature. But they’re definitely not the same hands that put all those steps on Bear Mountain. I don’t feel coddled by the trail like I sometimes felt in Connecticut. Instead, it’s rugged as fuck, but with a heart. Somehow, also, the trail manages to be a story teller of where you’re going, and the possibilities of where you could go. In Vermont, I could stand on Abraham and look south and see where I came from, and look north and see where I was headed, partly because the Green Mountains hug the ridgeline and there were few options to begin with. In Vermont, it was the mountains that told me where to go, but in Maine, it’s the trail. Coming down Baldpate, I could see the mountains laid out before me; I knew my future. I’m kind of in love, I’m definitely in awe.</p>
<p>Coming down toward Dunn Cascades, I heard a big animal lumber through the woods ahead of me, cross the trail, and stop. I could see it through the trees: it was a moose! I wasn’t fast enough to get a picture of it, but it was very cool. He or she didn’t stay very long, but just long enough.</p>
<p>I stopped at Hall Mountain Lean-to around 4pm. I could have kept going to the tent site a little further up, but I’m planning to go into town tomorrow with Bonk and DK, and there’s no need to walk further than we have to. Traveling with Bonk and DK has been pretty good — we travel alone enough that I still get to Hike My Own Hike and see mooses and what not, but the group dynamic also reels me in.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-28">AT Day 117: Hall Mountain Lean-to to Bemis Mountain Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/28/2024</div><div>12.8<!-- --> miles</div><div>1946.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->1959.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="64/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="51/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today was a nice resupply, even if it was a little expensive. There was basically only one place in town (two, if you count the ice cream shop), so it was pretty easy to decide how to spend our time. We spent most of the day either eating food inside at a table or snacking on food outside at a picnic bench. There was one especially “trail provides” moment when Bonk was exclaiming to DK and me that he just realized the post office was a mile or so away; not that a mile would be too far to walk, but it would definitely eat into the day time-wise. A few minutes later, a perfect stranger drives up and asks us (1) are we thru hiking the AT, (2) what’s our trail name, (3) do we need anything. A few minutes later, Bonk is in their truck on the way to the post office, and back again shortly thereafter. Just a lovely town.</p>
<p>While in town, I texted with Ted about when I thought I’d make it to Katahdin. I’ve had a Google spreadsheet with planned mileage and dates ever since I was planning to get together with John somewhere in New England. I can make changes offline and it syncs whenever I have signal, so it’s been a good way to share plans. I sent Ted a link to the spreadsheet, with caveat words like “notional” to say “I have no idea when I’m summiting, but this spreadsheet thinks it’s August 15th”.</p>
<p>This afternoon, as we were coming off the last mountain, I caught out of the corner of my eye the most gorgeous view of lakes out into the distance. Damn, Maine, you’ve got it going <em>on</em>.</p>
<p>Rabbit has finally caught up with me!! We’ve been texting back and forth; for a little while, I was even drawing up a spreadsheet of where I was planning to get to, in the hopes that it’d make it easier to plan how to meet up. And then it just happened that both of us were heading to Bemis Lean-to tonight; I didn’t even realize she was headed here for tonight until after leaving Andover. And now that she’s caught up, there’s a lot to catch up on!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-29">AT Day 118: Bemis Mountain Lean-to to Piazza Rock Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/29/2024</div><div>19.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>1959.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->1978.6<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="39/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="18/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>We got an even better glimpse of those water features from yesterday. Maine is beautiful! Bonk, Rabbit and I were chilling by an overlook, and a minute or so after Bonk pushed on, some guy (Sir Stops a Lot, amazing trail angel name) stopped and asked Rabbit and I if we wanted any trail magic. <em>Did we want any trail magic.</em> Heck yeah! He was a delight. We felt bad though for Bonk, who had missed out by only a minute or so.</p>
<p>Today was mostly just a day chillin’ with Rabbit, taking in amazing sights, and catching up on old times.</p>
<p>In trying to find the shelter tonight, we accidentally took a side trail that led to the eponymous Piazza Rock. It’s a big rock! Hopefully we can do some more exploring tomorrow. We met a southbounder in the shelter tonight who is carrying a bird. I don’t know the full story, but the sense I get is that this stopped being about a thru hike at some point and became a “go on an adventure with my bird friend who I will take care of” hike. Also there are two privies for the price of one at this shelter?! I’m too lazy to check it out, but it sounds amazing. Two privies, four walls, one really open friend.</p>
<p>My sleeping pad developed a leak — I don’t know when it first happened, but at least since I’ve been in Maine, I’ve had to wake up during the middle of the night to put air back in. It’s getting worse. I’m close-ish to the end, so I might just see it through? but hopefully I can see about fixing it, maybe when I get to Shaw’s.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-30">AT Day 119: Piazza Rock Lean-to to Spaulding Mtn Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/30/2024</div><div>16.9<!-- --> miles</div><div>1978.6<!-- --> to <!-- -->1995.5<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="64/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="55/100">😎</abbr></div></div><div><p>We were a half mile out this morning before I realized we missed out on learning more about Piazza Rock.

<p>Maine continues to deliver amazing vistas with spectacular water features. There’s just lakes <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>It’s nice to be staying in shelters again. I was kind of paying attention to my tent-to-shelter ratio, and it went hard tent when I hit the no-see-ums and stayed that way through mosquito territory, but it seems like I’m far enough north where I can pick either way.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-07-31">AT Day 120: Spaulding Mtn Lean-to to Hostel of Maine</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>7/31/2024</div><div>13.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>1995.5<!-- --> to <!-- -->2009<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Building">🏠</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="59/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="46/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>2000 miles! It was pretty tough getting there, though. There was an ugly steep descent off Sugarloaf in the morning, and I fell twice. Just stupid falls, really — I’m still not sleeping well, I think the sleeping pad leak is getting bigger. The second time I fell, I told Rabbit to go on without me. It’s something I’ve been trying to find a way to say—I prefer hanging out at camp, experiencing the trail solo—and when I said it, she asked me if I was sure, as if maybe she’s been wanting to let her legs free and I was holding her back. Maybe we miscommunicated on that.</p>
<p>Bonk and DK are staying at the Maine Roadhouse hostel, and Rabbit booked a spot at the Hostel of Maine. I go wherever the people go, so I told Rabbit I’d tag along to the Hostel of Maine with her, mostly so she wouldn’t feel alone. She had already been there for a bit when I arrived, about to tear into a pint of ice cream. I had an idea about sending Fluff a “here we are hanging out together with matching pints of ice cream” photo, so I tried check in quickly and buy some ice cream as the very first thing I did before settling down. When I got back to the porch with my pint, Rabbit was already well into her ice cream, and I kind of snapped a little bit, like “hey I thought we were gonna take a photo together for Fluff”. As soon as I said it, I recognized my tone was off, my whole self is off, and I need a solid night’s sleep. I’m staying in a bunk tonight, hopefully nobody around me has sleep apnea.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-01">AT Day 121: Hostel of Maine to Little Bigelow Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/1/2024</div><div>15.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>2009<!-- --> to <!-- -->2024.3<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="40/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="25/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I did not go to sleep early as planned. Breakfast, though, was really good, so if food can make up at all for lack of sleep, this morning’s breakfast did its damnedest.</p>
<p>This morning I started seeing signs for crossing the Kennebec. I’m not quite sure how far away it is, all I know is that I can’t ford it myself. That’s good, I don’t think I want to.</p>
<p>Maine really showed off today. Rugged beautiful trail on display, all day. These woods are just gorgeous to walk through. And the mountains, and their views! I’d heard southbounders talk about the Bigelows, but I wasn’t sure what to expect: were they tough? beautiful? A little bit of the former, but a LOT of the latter. Franconia Ridge, you have been ousted from the top spot. You’re very pretty, but the Bigelows are amazing. I feel so full.</p>
<p>I saw one sign along the trail for an “excellent view”, and someone wrote in sharpie on the sign “mid”. I felt compelled to check it out, and it was yet another stellar view. Even the stellar views here have stiff competition.</p>
<p>After the Bigelows, I had to book it. I passed one campsite that had FarOut comments about flooding in wet conditions, and I don’t want to chance it. I made it 5 miles later to Little Bigelow Lean-to by around 7pm, and was surprised to see that Rabbit had stopped at the same place. I had figured she’d have done more miles, but it really is hard to go heads down hard when you’re taking in the views from the top of the Bigelows. I asked her if she stopped at the excellent viewpoint, but she said no, she was turned off by the “mid”. She missed out!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-02">AT Day 122: Little Bigelow Lean-to to Pierce Pond Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/2/2024</div><div>17.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>2024.3<!-- --> to <!-- -->2042<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="46/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="time to recharge">🪫</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="22/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today was another pretty but very long day.

<p>I got to camp right around 3pm. There’s some kind of French-Canadian girl scout troupe (or something akin), they’re set up behind the shelter up on the hill. Tomorrow, a number of us are grabbing a pancake breakfast at a local camp. We went this afternoon to reserve a spot. The guy is really friendly, and I’ve decided to just ignore the huge Trump 2024 banner hanging by his door.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-03">AT Day 123: Pierce Pond Lean-to to Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/3/2024</div><div>18.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>2042<!-- --> to <!-- -->2060.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="59/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="45/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Another Long day! It started with pancakes, and they were worth it. Tim, the guy running it, had a little keyboard, and he invited me to play — I didn’t even have to ask! I noodled a bit, and wound up making a little melody that stuck with me for a bit. While we were eating, Tim played a mix of covers and originals. He’s got a cozy little spot here, and I think I respect him for doing what he can to hold on to it.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after pancakes, I got to ford my first Maine river! The water came up to my shorts, then crossing the Kennebec. In between fording and the Kennebec, I made a little ditty out of the melody from this morning: <em>“If you can’t ford the river, wait for me by the shore / ‘cause if you go and grow impatient, you might drown / I don’t want to find your body at the bottom of the river / so if you can’t ford the river, wait for me”</em>. Catching up to DK and Bonk by the river crossing, and I sang it to them. After a short wait while the ranger phoned in some info about a pack we had passed that was missing its owner, I crossed the river with Bonk. Another milestone in the books!</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, we got to the road for Carratunk, and everyone else but me boarded the shuttle headed for Sterling along with Chappie &#x26; co., and I was alone to hike the next 12 miles, at least until I caught up with Boone. We leapfrogged a few times; every time I’d cross a clearing, I kept pausing to either reserve a spot at Shaw’s, text my mom about mail drop, etc. Trail logistics continue to be a challenge. But it looks like everything that needs to be in motion is in motion!</p>
<p>I found a pretty good tent spot; Boone came in shortly after and ended up in the spot right next to me. A guy named Mouse is holding down the shelter all to himself — he says he’s an early riser, so I think a tent spot feels like a better bet tonight. Who knows, maybe I’ll sleep well!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-04">AT Day 124: Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to to Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/4/2024</div><div>13.0<!-- --> miles</div><div>2060.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->2073.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="84/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good sleep last night">😃</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="64/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>Two more stream crossings today!

The first stream crossing a few miles after the descent, but a FarOut comment with the instruction to stay to the right of a log made it pretty straightforward. The second one was just a few miles before finishing, and it was a bit deeper, but not moving too swiftly. Pretty straightforward day; the horseflies were probably the only difficult part.</p>
<p>Just the same, I dragged a bit, as I don’t have enough snacks, so I was rationing. Still, it was thankfully a very easy day. I got to shelter at 1:30 — it started thundering around 2, and stormed around 2:30. Again, I was lucky not to have to hike in that. Not too many at the shelter tonight- one section hiker going south, and 1 tent with two guys I saw at yesterday’s shelter, also headed NOBO. I’ll probably see some familiar faces at Shaw’s tomorrow.</p>

<p>SO much chillin’. Every place I walked today was within a city block of everything else. Everything I needed was either at the hostel, at the general store, or across the street at the Monson AT visitors center. And I saw some friendly faces today: Chattaa, Gremlin, and Judge arrived at Shaw’s!</p>
<p>It turns out that DK has a leak in her sleeping pad too; we tried the soap test, and found a leak, but when we patched it, it turned out that there were others as well. I was hoping to at least have the same luck in finding the leak on my pad, but we couldn’t find it. We even tried submerging it fully in the pond, but we couldn’t find anything. I’m not sure what to do. I could buy a replacement here, but I think there was only one or two pads in stock when DK bought one, and I don’t have a lot of spare room in my pack. I could also just deal with it for another week or so?</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get off Katahdin. There’s a visitors center with a ranger who can answer all sorts of questions, including “how do I meet up with someone on the summit when I don’t know when I’ll be there and there’s no cell service, and where can they park?“. I talked to Ted today and “solidified” a plan for meeting on Katahdin. Trail logistics are hard! I told him I wanted to meet on the summit after hiking up solo, instead of before the summit and hiking up together; I have no idea how I’m going to feel when I get there, but I just want to guard myself and give myself space. Ted has been super accommodating, it’s been a relief for him to be so flexible, I know it means a lot of work on his end.</p>
<p>I got into another conversation where I found myself defending New Hampshire. Speedboat was saying it should be more accessible. This feels a bit like the old MacKaye v. Avery debate, where MacKaye fights to uphold a pristine wilderness while Avery fights just to let people see it. As someone who grew up hiking through NH and never once felt like it was too hard (but rather, I just wasn’t hardy enough), I would be sad if they changed the trail. It feels almost sacred to me. And NH has probably the highest concentration of day hikers outside of the Smokies, so I don’t know that it’s scaring people away. I wonder sometimes if it isn’t that we get so used to hiking through the mid-Atlantic, we want the ease to continue all the way through, but I don’t think that’s it; Speedboat hikes faster than I do, I don’t imagine he has much trouble with the ascents. And the hiking community, New England included, has a pretty big problem around accessibility, so I don’t know why I’m defending the status quo. I think I’m just attached to my mountains. Maybe it’s Stockholm Syndrome. I also wonder if I’m just being disagreeable because I’m overtired. But it’s rubbed me the wrong way each time when people want the trail to conform to them. Correction: it’s rubbed me the wrong way when it was the trail I grew up on; I was one of those people who wanted other sections of the trail to conform to me. I just hope I didn’t come off as a dick.</p>
<p>I decided ultimately to forgo the food drop resupply option, and pack enough food for the entire 100 mile wilderness. This’ll be a heavy pack, but it feels sturdy enough.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-07">AT Day 127: Shaw&#x27;s Hostel in Monson, ME to Long Pond Stream Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/7/2024</div><div>15.1<!-- --> miles</div><div>2082.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->2097.8<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Shelter">🛖</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="36/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="29/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>This morning was a classic “always the last one out of camp”, hostel edition. I missed the first shuttle after breakfast. Poet said he might be able to make a second run if there was some interest, and I was too busy playing the hostel piano that when he finally said he was making the second run, I scrambled to get ready. I had planned to get some cash from the ATM in preparation for Baxter, but Bonk said he could spot me.</p>
<p>Poet has got his shuttle run speech down pat, like a good city bus tour guide. “And if you look to your left, you’ll see the largest waterfall on the AT.” “Is it taller than Amicalola Falls?” “Well no, but WATER GOOD. VERY PRETTY. YOU SAY AHH.” Entertaining, informative, guaranteed to get you excited for all of the remaining miles.</p>
<p>I had planned to keep my phone turned off for big chunks of the 100 mile wilderness, and I almost immediately regretted it- it’s so pretty! I turned my phone back on for a few spots including a cool waterfall, but (I’m sorry Poet) I have no idea if it’s the same waterfall Poet was pointing out from the car.</p>
<p>I’m seeing different people here inside the 100 Mile Wilderness than before; it’s strange, I don’t know if I should expect to see the same familiar faces, but there’s just a different crowd here with just a slightly different vibe. Maybe it’s because I was off trail for a day. Tonight in the shelter, it’s Bonk and me, and some other folks named MacGyver and Sweaty Beattie.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-08">AT Day 128: Long Pond Stream Lean-to to Mile 2113.2</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/8/2024</div><div>15.4<!-- --> miles</div><div>2097.8<!-- --> to <!-- -->2113.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="52/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->😐</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="31/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Hard day. It was settling in to be a hard day right from the start — after only a mile or so, I came up on a beautiful spot overlooking, well, everything, and I sat and ate probably too much food. Even here, I can see evidence of people (a logging road, maybe? or electricity wires?), but you really have to look for it. For the most part, it’s just open sky, trees, and lakes.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after an extended breakfast, I saw another moose! Err, I saw a moose butt. Its head was hidden by some trees, but I assume it was at least attached to the butt. Indirectly. And almost immediately after the moose butt, I crossed the last milestone: 2100 miles. I don’t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>A little while later, the trail crossed paths with a downed plane. From what I hear, everybody involved made it out safely, and the trail was actually rerouted <em>toward</em> the site of the crash. I think the opposite happens sometimes when people don’t make it out safely.</p>
<p>Around 2 or 2:30, I hit a shelter and sat down to try to figure out where to land for the night. Somebody came up behind me and pressed on, headed for Carl Newhall, but that seems so far away. Also, I was hoping to hit up the Gulf Hagas trail, as it’s supposed to be really nice. The weather will likely be terrible, but what if it’s not?</p>
<p>I ended up stealth camping right before the river. I have no idea if it’s allowed, but as far as I know, there’s no camping on the north side of the river, and there were clear spots for tents on the south side. Smiley set up in the same area, so at least there’s safety in numbers.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-09">AT Day 129: Mile 2113.2 to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/9/2024</div><div>24.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>2113.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->2137.7<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="46/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="29/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I trekked hard in the rain today. So long Hermitage, so long Gulf Hagas (maybe some day I’ll come back), it was hard to see much so I kept my head down and pushed on. I was lucky I had camped last night so close to the river; it wasn’t that high when I forded it this morning, but it’d probably be a lot higher now. I also had a hard time finding a privy in the morning (I thought it was behind me by half a mile, but it turned out I had camped right next to it!), which set me back almost an hour.</p>
<p>One of the peaks I went over, the last big one I think, had an above treeline summit, and oh the rain! from all angles! I figured though that if I hiked fast enough, I could build up enough heat to avoid hypothermia. That’s how that works, right?</p>
<p>I made it to the shelter with about an hour before sunset. The shelter is PACKED, which doesn’t bode well for future nights. Who knew the 100 mile wilderness would be full. There were only two tent spots left, and both of them were poor; I took the slightly less poor one, and Smiley got the supremely poor spot. Dude might not be fast, but he’s a trooper. Hopefully I’ll be able to dry my tent out a bit in the morning!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-10">AT Day 130: Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to to Wadleigh Stream Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/10/2024</div><div>21.5<!-- --> miles</div><div>2137.7<!-- --> to <!-- -->2159.2<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="48/100">😶‍🌫️</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="26/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>Maine continues to have cool features. I passed a lake! With a tide! It was big! Today was mostly speedy, with a few sections where I felt like I was running out of gas. Lots of roots, and I’d like to think I’m ok with them, but they were getting tired after a while. I caught a glimpse of Katahdin, with its summit in the clouds.</p>
<p>I got to the shelter by 4:15pm or so, and chatted with some nice section hikers. Bonk and DK arrived a few hours later, and we chatted about summit plans. I think I’m going to summit with them. It’ll be cool to be summiting with someone I know — I thought about going lone gun, but there’s just too many strangers in this section, and not all of them are great. I hope I can make to the ranger station in time to get a spot at the Birches.</p>
<p>I had a cool “trail provides” experience during dinner. Before lighting my stove, I put my lighter down on top of my lid, which promptly did a 180º, plopping my lighter down into my pot of water. I tried lighting the lighter, and no luck. Will it light eventually? I don’t know! I asked the woman camped next to me if she might have a lighter I could borrow for a moment or two; not only did she have a lighter, she had <em>three</em>, including a piezo igniter. She even let me keep her mini bic lighter! The trail provides!</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-11">AT Day 131: Wadleigh Stream Lean-to to Abol Pines</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/11/2024</div><div>23.2<!-- --> miles</div><div>2159.2<!-- --> to <!-- -->2182.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="79/100">🤩</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="good recovery">😀</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="61/100">💪</abbr></div></div><div><p>Today was just a beautiful day on trail. All the heavy lifting is done, aside from the last day. I got some views of Katahdin, but I had to take breaks to pay Shaw’s (whoops, I really left in a hurry didn’t I) and message Ted. Meeting up with him on the summit still feels like a loose plan but I think it’ll work out!</p>
<p>The trail literally crossed a beach today. Oh Maine, you had me at hello, please stop.</p>
<p>We’re at Abol Pines, officially out of the 100 mile wilderness. I bought way too many snacks. Bonk, DK and I were chatting about what ridiculous heavy thing we might pack out for our last night. DK is bringing a can of Chef Boyardee. We also got some trail magic from Judge’s parents: a full-sized lobster roll. I had to split it with DK, I was so snack-laden.</p>
<p>Originally I was going to stay at Hurd, but I decided to press on as there seems to be a lot of people summiting and I wanted to make sure I get a spot at the Birches. So Bonk, DK, Smiley and I found a spot at Abol Pines — some guy says that there might be some people up late partying, which kind of got me upset, but I’m going to follow others’ lead and let it wash.</p>
<p>Sleep now, Ranger’s station in the morning. Boo, it’s raining… I just spent 2 days getting things dry. This too shall pass.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-12">AT Day 132: Abol Pines to The Birches Lean-to</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/12/2024</div><div>9.7<!-- --> miles</div><div>2182.4<!-- --> to <!-- -->2192.1<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Tent">🏕️</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="45/100">🥱</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="32/100">😰</abbr></div></div><div><p>I’m on the list! It’ll be me, Bonk, DK, Chattaa, Judge, Gremlin, Smiley, MacGyver, Sweaty Beattie, and Lady Slipper. Out of all of those people, MacGyver and Sweaty Beattie are the only two I met in the 100 mile wilderness; I met Lady Slipper around the beginning of Maine, Smiley in NH, Chattaa and crew at the ice cream challenge, and I think I met Bonk and DK in PA, or at least somewhere close to a Wawa.</p>
<p>We had pretty much all day to walk the 10 miles to the Birches, so we chilled out for a bit at Abol Bridge again. I’m glad I didn’t stay at Hurd last night — I saw a group of three hikers chilling at Abol Bridge who said they were just shy of getting a spot in the Birches, and they were having a hard time finding another spot elsewhere. That was almost me.</p>
<p>The walk through Baxter was the most relaxing walk of the trail. It’s as if every bird was chirping, “relax, you did it. You got this.” On other days of the trail, Katahdin felt like the final boss, but today—dare I say it—it feels like a victory lap, the cherry on top, the prize, the pot of gold at the end of a long rainbow. We all had lunch at a library of sorts in the park, and I watched Judge take a canoe out on the pond, with Katahdin as the backdrop.</p>
<p>I got to the Birches a little after 3pm and set up my tent for the last time. Had my last meal. All I have left in my pack is snacks for tomorrow. I think most other people are slack packing, but Snitches and every other piece of kit is coming with me. They’re not going to miss this.</p></div></article><article class="entry"><h2 class="cursor-pointer text-green-900 hover:underline" id="2024-08-13">AT Day 133: The Birches Lean-to to Mount Katahdin</h2><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>8/13/2024</div><div>5.3<!-- --> miles</div><div>2192.1<!-- --> to <!-- -->2197.4<!-- --> miles</div></div><div class="flex gap-4 text-sm"><div>Slept in: <abbr title="Building">🏠</abbr></div><div>Sleep quality: <abbr title="59/100">🙃</abbr></div><div>State: <abbr title="find time to relax">😰</abbr></div><div>Mood: <!-- -->🙂</div><div>Readiness: <abbr title="38/100">🫥</abbr></div></div><div><p>Of course I was the last one out of camp this morning. Of course I had to get up in the middle of the night to pee.</p>
<p>Katahdin is a beautiful mountain. I think this is maybe the third time I’ve hiked it, at least, but I’ve never done the Hunt trail. Every path up is a bit different, I guess. It started off fairly gently, and I got to say hello to some of the other hikers who were doing the hike with their families. Soon, it got into boulders, and I decided to take them as aggressively as possible. I cleared tree line shortly after, and</p>
<p>Oh my God. It’s beautiful, and <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>The steep part eventually gave way to flat, what I remember being called The Tablelands from other ascents but I might be conflating that with something else. I had to focus on keeping my feet dry through the Thoreau Spring section, but <em>it’s happening</em>.</p>
<p>Soon, the summit came into view, and I could see some people I didn’t recognize getting their photo by the sign, and <em>everything</em> just came back to me in a flood, I remembered everything, the Georgia sunrises, the late starts, <em>the trail provides!</em>, every memory all at once, and I started to heave and tear up, and then I got to the summit, and said hello to the people who had just finished taking their own photo. Their mood changed when I told them I had just finished the AT.</p>
<p>Ted arrived about 20 minutes after me, in typical Ted fashion! He asked the entire mountain if there was a Marathon Man present. It was so good to see him.</p>
<p>We made time to hike the Knife Edge and back, down the Abol trail, and now I’m done. I’m done, I hiked the AT.</p>
<p>I think I know how Alexander the Great must have felt as he wept, seeing as there were no more worlds to conquer. I’m still not sure how it feels to finish the AT; I’ll have to let that process for a little bit before it feels real. Time to go home.</p></div></article><h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve been home from the trail for a little while now. In some ways, it was really easy to get back into the swing of city life, sometimes unsettlingly easy. Ted drove us in my car back to a local motel after we got off the mountain, but I drove us from Maine to Boston the next day. I hadn&#x27;t driven in months, let alone a standard transmission, but I remembered every inch of how to drive like a Masshole.</p>
<p>Other parts of life proved harder to adapt. I miss waking and sleeping with the sun. It was a point of pride on the trail to not have to rely on an alarm clock as a general rule, and now I have to keep my blinds closed so that the street lights don&#x27;t keep me up. Adapting to 3 square meals a day has taken time, and I&#x27;ve struggled with the lack of a constant flow of endorphins. I&#x27;ve had to watch my body become less efficient, and there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it, realistically.</p>
<p>At some point, I finished reading <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55120630-the-comfort-crisis">The Comfort Crisis</a></em>, Rabbit&#x27;s book recommendation in which Michael Easter goes on a <a href="https://www.twopct.com/p/whats-your-misogi">misogi</a> and comes back a better person. But he says that, eventually, the effects wear off, and he gets used to the comfortable life again. Being comfortable with being uncomfortable is not a &quot;one and done&quot; action; I&#x27;ll have to work at it continuously.</p>
<p>Some people have asked me, <em>&quot;how was it?&quot;</em> and I have no idea how to answer that question. There are so many different dimensions, and each one of them was rich and complicated. I could speak for a long time on any part of it.</p>
<p>Others have asked me, <em>&quot;would I do it again?&quot;</em> and this is easier to answer, at least in the short term. If I were to go back in time, I&#x27;d absolutely do it again, and again, and again. It was the right thing to do at the right time, and I&#x27;m absolutely glad I made an opportunity to do it. But would I hike the Appalachian Trail, or another similar trail, now? Again? After having hiked it already? I&#x27;m not sure. I struggled with being a tourist, I struggled with days running into each other.</p>
<p>What I think this means for me, at least right now, is more smaller hikes, in the timespan of weeks instead of months. Just long enough to take me out of my element, but not so long that I get complacent, or start picking my nose in front of dayhikers. And I&#x27;ve built up a list of potential future thrus, from the <a href="https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/john-muir-trail/">John Muir Trail</a> to the <a href="https://superiorhiking.org/">Superior Hiking Trail</a> to the <a href="https://coloradotrail.org/">Colorado Trail</a> to the <a href="https://mdhta.com/">Maah Daah Hey Trail</a> and more. In keeping with the Robert Frost theme, I still have miles to go before I sleep.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge all the people that helped me take the roughly 5,000,000 steps from Georgia to Maine. From the thru hikers I met along the way, to the trail angels that gave me a ride or some food, to the family members who held things together at home and mailed me whatever I needed as I needed it, to the friends and family that checked in occasionally to see how I was doing, and last but not least the friends and family who came out to visit me at points along the way. I couldn&#x27;t have taken the steps without all of your support.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks for reading. While I wrote this largely for myself as an exercise in reflection, I hope you got something out of this as well, either as an inspiration or as an insight into life on the trail. Please feel free to reach out to me if there&#x27;s anything you&#x27;d like to chat about!</p></div></div></div></main></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script async="" src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-RRV7K7BCCR"></script><script>
